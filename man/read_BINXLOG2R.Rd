\title{Import Risø BINX-data from the BINX Log File}
\usage{
read_BINXLOG2R(file, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{\link{character} (\strong{required}): ASCII log file to read. There is no check
the file extension; just see whether it works or not.}

\item{verbose}{\link{logical} (\emph{with default}): enable/disable output to the terminal.}

\item{...}{further arguments that will be passed to the function (currently not used)}
}
\value{
Returns an S4 \linkS4class{RLum.Analysis} object or a \link{list} of it.
}
\description{
The function attempts to extract meaningful measurement data from the
log file (\code{.txt}) stored along with a BINX file if this option was chosen.
This is particularly helpful if the BINX file is broken and the data would
be lost otherwise.
}
\details{
This function is basically a hack trying to make the most out of a broken file in case
at least the log file is salvageable. Please do not expect black magic; the extract is
very basic, and the function was written to work for TL, OSL, IRSL curves only.
If it breaks, it breaks.

\strong{TL curve extraction}
Since the BIN/BINX do not contain x-values, they also cannot be created magically
here. To avoid problems with the conversion, we assume always BIN-file version \code{3} for
the conversion. This should be okay in most cases, however, it may become problematic
if you have data for dedicated curve analysis.
}
\note{
This function tries to extract data from a log file produced for debugging
purposes. There is no guarantee regarding the format stability, and the
function is meant as a last resort if your BIN/BINX files are unusable.
