\description{
This function calculates the cosmic dose rate taking into account the soft-
and hard-component of the cosmic ray flux and allows corrections for
geomagnetic latitude, altitude above sea-level and geomagnetic field
changes.
}
\details{
This function calculates the total cosmic dose rate considering both the
soft- and hard-component of the cosmic ray flux.

\strong{Internal calculation steps}

(1)
Calculate total depth of all absorber in hg/cm^2 (1 hg/cm^2 = 100 g/cm^2)

\deqn{absorber = depth_1*density_1 + depth_2*density_2 + ... + depth_n*density_n}

(2)
If \code{half.depth = TRUE}

\deqn{absorber = absorber/2}

(3)
Calculate cosmic dose rate at sea-level and 55 deg. latitude

a) If absorber is > 167 g/cm^2 (only hard-component; Allkofer et al.  1975):
apply equation given by Prescott & Hutton (1994) (c.f. Barbouti & Rastin
1983)

\deqn{D0 = C/(((absorber+d)^\alpha+a)*(absober+H))*exp(-B*absorber)}

b) If absorber is < 167 g/cm^2 (soft- and hard-component): derive D0 from
Fig. 1 in Prescott & Hutton (1988).

(4)
Calculate geomagnetic latitude (Prescott & Stephan 1982, Prescott &
Hutton 1994)

\deqn{\lambda = arcsin(0.203*cos(latitude)*cos(longitude-291)+0.979*
sin(latitude))}

(5)
Apply correction for geomagnetic latitude and altitude above sea-level.
Values for F, J and H were read from Fig. 3 shown in Prescott & Stephan
(1982) and fitted with 3-degree polynomials for lambda < 35 degree and a
linear fit for lambda > 35 degree.

\deqn{Dc = D0*(F+J*exp((altitude/1000)/H))}

(6)
Optional: Apply correction for geomagnetic field changes in the last
0-80 ka (Prescott & Hutton 1994). Correction and altitude factors are given
in Table 1 and Fig. 1 in Prescott & Hutton (1994). Values for altitude
factor were fitted with a 2-degree polynomial. The altitude factor is
operated on the decimal part of the correction factor.

\deqn{Dc' = Dc*correctionFactor}

\strong{Usage of \code{depth} and \code{density}}

(1) If only one value for depth and density is provided, the cosmic dose
rate is calculated for exactly one sample and one absorber as overburden
(i.e. \code{depth*density}).

(2) In some cases it might be useful to calculate the cosmic dose rate for a
sample that is overlain by more than one absorber, e.g. in a profile with
soil layers of different thickness and a distinct difference in density.
This can be calculated by providing a matching number of values for
\code{depth} and \code{density} (e.g. \verb{depth = c(1, 2), density = c(1.7, 2.4)})

(3) Another possibility is to calculate the cosmic dose rate for more than
one sample of the same profile. This is done by providing more than one
values for \code{depth} and only one for \code{density}. For example,
\code{depth = c(1, 2, 3)} and \code{density = 1.7} will calculate the cosmic dose rate
for three samples in 1, 2 and 3 m depth in a sediment of density 1.7 g/cm^3.
}
\note{
Despite its universal use the equation to calculate the cosmic dose
rate provided by Prescott & Hutton (1994) is falsely stated to be valid from
the surface to 10^4 hg/cm^2 of standard rock. The original expression by
Barbouti & Rastin (1983) only considers the muon flux (i.e. hard-component)
and is by their own definition only valid for depths between 10-10^4
hg/cm^2.

Thus, for near-surface samples (i.e. for depths < 167 g/cm^2) the equation
of Prescott & Hutton (1994) underestimates the total cosmic dose rate, as it
neglects the influence of the soft-component of the cosmic ray flux. For
samples at zero depth and at sea-level the underestimation can be as large
as ~0.1 Gy/ka. In a previous article, Prescott & Hutton (1988) give another
approximation of Barbouti & Rastin's equation in the form of

\deqn{D = 0.21*exp(-0.070*absorber+0.0005*absorber^2)}

which is valid for depths between 150-5000 g/cm^2. For shallower depths (<
150 g/cm^2) they provided a graph (Fig. 1) from which the dose rate can be
read.

As a result, this function employs the equation of Prescott & Hutton (1994)
only for depths > 167 g/cm^2, i.e. only for the hard-component of the cosmic
ray flux. Cosmic dose rate values for depths < 167 g/cm^2 were obtained from
the "AGE" program (Gruen 2009) and fitted with a 6-degree polynomial curve
(and hence reproduces the graph shown in Prescott & Hutton 1988). However,
these values assume an average overburden density of 2 g/cm^3.

It is currently not possible to obtain more precise cosmic dose rate values
for near-surface samples as there is no equation known to the author of this
function at the time of writing.
