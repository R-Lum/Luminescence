\title{Apply crosstalk}
\usage{
apply_Crosstalk(object, n_crosstalk = 0.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\linkS4class{RLum.Results} or \link{numeric} (\strong{required}):
a numerical vector of length 100, representing one or more measurement
discs ("positions") in a reader.
Each element in the vector represents one grain hole location on a disc.}

\item{n_crosstalk}{\link{numeric} (\emph{with default}):
A single number quantifying the added
crosstalk. Defaults for testing purposes to 0.2. Can be any number, even negative,
but for realistic simulations we suggest something between 0 and 0.25.}
}
\value{
A vector of size 100, with the value at each grain hole location including
simulated crosstalk.
}
\description{
Add crosstalk, evenly spread in rook (top-right-bottom-left)
directions, to all grain whole locations on one measurement discs
(=on position on a measurement wheel in a reader). An
added crosstalk value of as example 0.2 means that 0.2 of the value of
the central grain is added to each grain in the rook directions. This is an additive
action: the central grain itself is not affected by this operation (but will on its
turn increase because of crosstalk from its neighbours).
This function is used for simulations: can this added crosstalk be detected?
}
\details{
If an element in \code{object} is \code{NA}, it is internally set to 0, so it will not
be added.

\examples{
## Create artificial disc observation
observations <- set_RLum(class = "RLum.Results",
                         data = list(vn_values = rep(x = c(1,2), each = 50))
                       )
hist(get_RLum(object = observations))

## Add crosstalk (with default set to 0.2), and visualize the difference
## in the resulting histogram.
observations_with_simulated_crosstalk <- apply_Crosstalk(observations)
hist(observations_with_simulated_crosstalk)
