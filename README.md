## Installation

#### i. Requirements

With release of version 0.4.2 part of the *analyse\_IRSAR.RF()* function
was rewritten in C++ to increase its perfomance. This inevitably
introduced the requirement for the GNU Compiler Collection (*gcc*) when
the R package ‘Luminescence’ is installed from source. Depending on your
OS please download and install one of the following:

**Windows (32/64bit)** - ‘Rtools’ (provided by CRAN)

<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>

**Mac OS X** - ‘Xcode’ (provided by Apple)

<https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/>

For **Linux** users *gcc* often comes pre-installed in most
distributions. Should *gcc* be not available, however, we kindly refer
to the exhaustive collection of installation guides depending on the
linux distribution.

#### ii. Install the package

##### Since version 0.8.0 with RStudio

Install any development versions using our *RStudio* add-in

![](man/figures/README-Screenshot_AddIn.png)

##### The plain **R** way

To install the stable version from CRAN, simply run the following from
an R console:

``` r
install.packages("Luminescence")
```

To install the latest development builds directly from GitHub, run

``` r
if(!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("R-Lum/Luminescence@master")
```

To install a developer build other than ‘master’, replace the term
‘master’ in the codeline by the name of the wanted developer build.

## Contribute

The R luminescence project is based on and evolves from ideas,
contributions and constructive criticism of its users. Help us to
