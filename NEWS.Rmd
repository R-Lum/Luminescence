# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

## New functions

* `read_BINXLOG2R()`: This new function enables you to salvage log files created 
by a Risø reader into R as `RLum.Analysis-class`. The function also allows the 
export of these files into a BIN/BINX format. While the function has been tested 
on a few examples, it is important to note that log files are never a well-defined 
data format. This function is intended for use in cases where you have a corrupted 
BIN/BINX file but a complete log file is still available. Supported log formats 
are TL, OSL, and OSL curves. All other formats are ignored.
Thanks to Michael Kenzler for bringing this to our attention (@RLumSK with #1241).

## Removed functions and deprecations

* Functions `github_branches()`, `github_commits()`, `github_issues()`,
`is.RLum()`, `is.RLum.Analysis()`, `is.RLum.Data()`, `is.RLum.Data.Curve()`,
`is.RLum.Data.Image()`, `is.RLum.Data.Spectrum()` and `is.RLum.Results()`
(deprecated since 1.1.2) have been removed (#1242).

## Bugfixes and changes

### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`

* No automated resetting of the dose value anymore, if `mode = "alternate"`.
If the first dose point was > 0, the function detected a dose-recovery test
and automatically reset this dose point to 0. While this is likely convenient 
in 9 out of 10 cases, it caused trouble if the `mode = "alternate"` (passed on 
to `fit_DoseResponseCurve()` because it modified the first dose point and this 
required additional handling afterwards. Please keep in mind that you
have to redefine the recuperation reference in such a case: this is wanted 
and not a bug.

### `read_XSYG2R()`

* Attributes from the record level are now all included in the `@info` slot,
as long as they do not duplicate the attributes from the curve level. Hence,
those attributes are now available for filtering (#1239; thanks to
@DirkMittelstrass for reporting).
