# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

## New functions


## Bugfixes

### `get_RLum()`
* When the function was used on a list of `RLum.Analysis-class` objects with the argument `null.rm = TRUE` it would 
remove all `NULL` objects, but not elemnts that became `list()` (empty list) during the selection; fixed.

### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`
* Add support for `lphi` and `ltheta` light direction arguments for `plot.type = "persp"`. 
* Fix the reason for the unclear warning `In col.unique == col :  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length`
