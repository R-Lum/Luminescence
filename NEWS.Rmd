# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.1**

## Bugfixes and changes

### `plot_GrowthCurve()`
* The function crashed for the setting `plot_GrowthCurve(..., mode = "alternate", fit.method = "LambertW")`; fixed (#114, @Eiskeil, thanks for reporting).
