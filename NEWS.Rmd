# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.1**

## Bugfixes and changes

### `convert_PSL2CSV()` 
* The function still contained a bug if the parameters were combined in a certain way; fixed.

### `merge_RLum()`
* The functions does not crash anymore in cases only one object is handed over to `merge_RLum()` (which 
does not make sense anyway, but users tend to odd stuff)

### `plot_DetPlot()` 
* The function now returns a clear error message if the input object is not of type `RLum.Analysis`

### `write_RLum2CSV()`
* The behaviour of the parameter `prefix` caused confusion, because in combination with multiple files the function 
overwrote created files, although this was wanted behaviour now the prefix is always added to the automatically created files names.
