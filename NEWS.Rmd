# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

## New functions

## Breaking changes

## Renamed functions and deprecations

## Bugfixes

### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()` 
* The function crashed if the number of `Lx` and `Tx` curves was not equal
when `structure = c("Lx", "Tx")`, which is the default. The check that the
number of points within each pair of curves has also been improved, and the
function now produces more helpful error messages (#616).

### `calc_OSLLxTxRatio()`
* The function returned a warning for wrong integral settings for the `Tx` curve even if no `Tx` curve was provided; fixed. 
* The function does not check any more of different object types for `Lx.data` and `Tx.data` but validate objects for allowed types (this should have no user-visible effects)

### `calc_Huntely2006()`

* Add support for nls-fitting control arguments `maxiter` and `trace`.

### `convert_Concentration2DoseRate()`

* The function validates its input values more thoroughly (#613).

### `fit_DoseResponseCurve()`

* The function now allocates less memory for storing intermediate values
(#610).

### `sort_RLum()`
* The sorting method for `RLum.Analysis-class` objects become more powerful. The method
now supports sorting after multiple paramters such as sort and all available info elements.
