# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.2**

## Bugfixes and changes

### `calc_Huntely2006()`
* If the age is `NA` due to `Ln/Tn` values lower than the smallest simulated `Lx/Tx` value, 
a warning with an explanation is returned. Thanks to Christina Neudorf for providing the test
dataset.

### `read_BIN2R()`
* Argument `n.records` can now be provided as a vector to specifically 
select records for the import. All other records are skipped and not imported. 
This can be useful in particular for very large BIN/BINX-files because
allows importing single records very quickly without parsing the entire 
file
* The function learned about `RECTYPE` 128 records and can now import
them (before those records were skipped). As it is in the original format, these information are only appended to the BIN/BINX file, means they do not really represent measurement data. 

### `plot_GrowthCurve()`
* Edge case: If the `Ln/Tn` values was way below the fit and `fit.method = EXP` was chosen for the fitting,
the function still returned a positive equivalent dose for `mode = interpolation`. Now the returned value
is `NA` since no interpolation was possible.

### `Risoe.BINfileData-class()`
* The `show` method now knows about `RECTYPE` 128 and will account for it.

### `Risoe.BINFfileData2RLum.Analysis()` 
* The function learned about `RECTYPE` 128 records. Those records contain ROI 
data from camera measurements and are skipped for the moment because they do not 
really belong to measurement data. This may change future.
