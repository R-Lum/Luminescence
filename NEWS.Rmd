# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.4**

## New functions


## Removed functions and deprecations

* The functions `CW2pHMi()`, `CW2pLM()`, `CW2pLMi()` and `CW2pPMi()`
(deprecated since 1.0.0) have been removed, but their functionality remains
in the corresponding `convert_CW2*()` functions (#992).

* Functions `github_commits()`, `github_branches()` and `github_issues()` are
now deprecated and will be removed in a future release (#1026).

* Functions `is.RLum()`, `is.RLum.Data()`, `is.RLum.Data.Curve()`,
`is.RLum.Data.Spectrum()`, `is.RLum.Data.Image()`, `is.RLum.Analysis()` and
`is.RLum.Results()`,  and are now deprecated and will be removed in a future
release. The best way of testing whether an object is of a given type is by
using the `inherits()` function, as in `inherits(object, "RLum.Data.Curve")`
(#1034).

## Bugfixes and changes

### `analyse_baSAR()`

* The function no longer crashes if all objects in the input list are removed
because empty (#1041).

### `combine_De_Dr()`

* It is now possible to control the random seeds used by the JAGS MCMC chains
via the `method_control` argument (#1038).

### `fit_EmissionSpectra()`

* The function makes better use of the plot area, leaving smaller margins
around the plot (#1011).

### `fit_OSLLifeTimes()`

* The function throws a warning when the fit fails (#1005).

* The function makes better use of the plot area, leaving smaller margins
around the plot (#1011).

### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`

* A warning was raised if the function returned early (for example due to
invalid inputs) and the graphical device was off (#1001).

* The function now validates the `frame` argument in order to avoid crashing
on misspecified values (#1036).

### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`

* Setting `records_max` to a value larger than the number of curves no longer
generates spurious legend entries (#1017).

* The function now supports plotting of `RLum.Data.Image` objects contained
in its records (#1028).

### `plot_RLum.Data.Image()`

* The function now supports the `...` argument `mtext` (#1031).

### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`

* The function doesn't crash anymore if `bg.spectrum` is used and `ylim`
specifies an interval that doesn't contain any background channels (#1019).

* The function doesn't crash anymore if the value of `frames` given is too
large when `plot.type = "multiple.lines"` (#1021).
