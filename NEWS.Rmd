# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.3**

## Bugfixes

### read_BIN2R()
* `ignore.RECTYPE` now supports numeric values, e.g., 128. Records for this type
will be ignored during import.


## Internals
* New internal function + tests added `.get_named_list_element()`. It just does what 
the names says.
