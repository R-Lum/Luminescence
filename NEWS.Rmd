# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

## New functions

## Breaking changes

## Renamed functions and deprecations

## Bugfixes

### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()` 
* The function crashed if the number of `Lx` and `Tx` curves was not equal for the 
setting `structure = c("Lx", "Tx")` (which is the default) (fixed; #616)

### `calc_OSLLxTxRatio()`
* The function returned a warning for wrong integral settings for the `Tx` curves even no `Tx` curves were provided; fixed. 
* The function does not check any more of different object types for `Lx.data` and `Tx.data` but for valid objects (this 
should have no visible effect to the user)

### `calc_Huntely2006()`

* Add support for nls-fitting control arguments `maxiter` and `trace`.

### `convert_Concentration2DoseRate()`

* The function validates its input values more thoroughly (#613).

### `fit_DoseResponseCurve()`

* The function now allocates less memory for storing intermediate values
(#610).
