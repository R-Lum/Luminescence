# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.1**

## Bugfixes and changes

### `analyse_portableOSL()`
* If `invert = TRUE` the y-axis is now also inverted. 
* Gained a new argument `mode` with two options `'profil'` and `'surface'`. 
* Support surface interpolation and coordinates extraction
* **Potentially breaking changes** `...` argument `sample` was changed to `run` better complying with the 
terminology of the PSL format

### `read_PSL()`
* Remove unwanted characters less aggressively from sample name; with this new setting, coordinates 
can be passed.

### `plot_GrowthCurve()`
* The function crashed for the setting `plot_GrowthCurve(..., mode = "alternate", fit.method = "LambertW")`; fixed (#114, @Eiskeil, thanks for reporting).
* Now throws a warning in `mode = "extrapolation", fit.method = "LambertW"` of the standard root estimation 
failed and hence the results can become inconclusive. 

## Internals
* Adding new dependency to 'interp'
