# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

## New functions


## Breaking changes

## Renamed functions and deprecations

## Bugfixes

### `analyse_baSAR()`

* The number of aliquots used was only partially reported if no aliquots were
removed.

### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`

* The function checks that an input object generated from an XSYG file
contains irradiation steps and returns an error if none are available,
instead of producing an unhelpful output (#588).

* A regression in `plot_RLum.Analysis()` caused part of the plot of the
luminescence curves to be messed up (#589).

### `calc_FastRatio()`

* The function crashed if the input was an RLum.Analysis object (#586).

### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`

* The `xlim`, `ylim` and `zlim` parameters are now better validated to avoid
possible crashes if misspecified (#581).

### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`

* The function reset incorrectly the graphical parameters for the case
`plot_singlePanels = TRUE`. This caused a regression in the plot output
from `analyse_FadingMeasurement()` (#589).
