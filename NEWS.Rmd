# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.1**

## Bugfixes and changes

### `analyse_portableOSL()` (**potentially breaking changes**)
The function received a major update, including an updated output object. Please 
make sure that you read the changes before updating, because it may break your existing code!

* New argument `mode` added with two options `'profile'` (the default) and `'surface'`. The latter is intended for 2D surface interpolation of luminescence signals and was newly added. 
* New argument `coord` added, to allow the user to provide a list or matrix of xy-coordinates of the sampling position. 
If nothing is provided, the coordinates are extracted from the file name or an index is calculated. 
* The function now always translates input order in x and y coordinates, to have the treatment consistent.
* In profile mode, the function now returns also the dark count values with their standard deviation. The dark counts
can also be plotted in the surface mode, although it probably does not make much sense. 
* `invert = TRUE` the y-axis is now also inverted and the inversion works more consistently 
* `...` argument `sample` was changed to `run` better complying with the terminology of the PSL format, where
the sample name is called run.
* `...` supports a lot more arguments to enable better plot modifications in particular for the newly added
surface interpolation mode. 

### `read_PSL()`
* Remove unwanted characters less aggressively from sample name; with this new setting, coordinates 
can be passed.

### `plot_GrowthCurve()`
* The function crashed for the setting `plot_GrowthCurve(..., mode = "alternate", fit.method = "LambertW")`; fixed (#114, @Eiskeil, thanks for reporting).
* Now throws a warning in `mode = "extrapolation", fit.method = "LambertW"` of the standard root estimation 
failed and hence the results can become inconclusive. 

## Internals
* Adding new dependency to 'interp'
