# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

## New functions

## Breaking changes

## Renamed functions and deprecations

## Bugfixes

### `calc_OSLLxTxRatio()`
* The function returned a warning for wrong integral settings for the Tx curves even no Tx curves were provided; fixed. 
* The function does not check anymore of different object types for `Lx.data` and `Tx.data` but for valid objects (this 
should have no visible effect to the user)

### `calc_Huntely2006()`

* Add support for nls-fitting control arguments `maxiter` and `trace`.

### `convert_Concentration2DoseRate()`

* The function validates its input values more thoroughly (#613).

### `fit_DoseResponseCurve()`

* The function now allocates less memory for storing intermediate values
(#610).
