# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.4**

## New functions


## Removed functions and deprecations

* The functions `CW2pHMi()`, `CW2pLM()`, `CW2pLMi()` and `CW2pPMi()`
(deprecated since 1.0.0) have been removed, but their functionality remains
in the corresponding `convert_CW2*()` functions (#992).

## Bugfixes and changes

### `fit_EmissionSpectra()`

* The function throws a warning when the fit fails (#1005).

* The function makes better use of the plot area, leaving smaller margins
around the plot (#1011).

### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`

* A warning was raised if the function returned early (for example due to
invalid inputs) and the graphical device was off (#1001).

### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`

* Setting `records_max` to a value larger than the number of curves no longer
generates spurious legend entries (#1017).
