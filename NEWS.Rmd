# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.4**

## New functions


## Removed functions and deprecations

* The functions `CW2pHMi()`, `CW2pLM()`, `CW2pLMi()` and `CW2pPMi()`
(deprecated since 1.0.0) have been removed, but their functionality remains
in the corresponding `convert_CW2*()` functions (#992).

## Bugfixes and changes

### `fit_EmissionSpectra()`

* The function uses the correct indices reported by `split.screen()`, which
prevents some graphical errors if run in a parallel setting (#1007).

### `fit_OSLLifeTimes()`

* The function throws a warning when the fit fails (#1005).

* The function uses the correct indices reported by `split.screen()`, which
prevents some graphical errors if run in a parallel setting (#1007).

### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`

* A warning was raised if the function returned early (for example due to
invalid inputs) and the graphical device was off (#1001).
