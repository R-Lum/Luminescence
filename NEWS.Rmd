# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.2**

## New functions
* `trim_RLum.Data()`: This new function enables to trim off the number of channels of all supported `RLum.Data-class` on the time domain. For instance, an OSL curve (`RLum.Data.Curve-class`) has 1000 channels, one may
want to extract only channels 10 to 100. Moreover, sometimes, `RLum.Data-class` objects have a different number
of channels but are otherwise measured with the same time resolution. Until now,
it was possible to merge those curves, but the subsequent analysis usually failed because
most of the analysis functions check whether the number of channels matches. 

## Bugfixes and changes

### `analyse_IRSARRF()`
* The function crashed for `RF_nat.lim` settings with two parameters; fixed (thanks to Mariana Sontag-Gonzalez for reporting)
* The function gained a new argument option for `method`: `"VSLIDE"`. If set, the vertical sliding with the range set to `"auto"` is used for the estimation of the equivalent dose.

### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`
* The function gained a new argument `trim_channels`. The default is `FALSE` to do 
not break existing code. If `TRUE` OSL and IRSL are curves are checked for the lowest
number of channels on the curves and then all curves are trimmed accordingly using 
`trim_RLum.Data()`. This should fix an issue where data could not be analysed 
due to different channel numbers erroneously produced by the luminescence readers.
* The dose points names are returned as `factors` (which they are) instead of `characters`, with 
their class in the correct order. If you expect character values this may break existing code.
* The `$data` element gained two new columns `ALQ` and `POS` where the functions tries to store
data about the running aliquot number and the position of the aliquot in the reader. The latter
can only be accessed if this information was provided in measurement data (e.g., XSYG or BIN/BINX)

### `calc_Huntely2006()`
* If the age is `NA` due to `Ln/Tn` values lower than the smallest simulated `Lx/Tx` value, 
a warning with an explanation is returned. Thanks to Christina Neudorf for providing the test
dataset.
* Better catch a few uncontrolled errors and improve the success of the fitting (thanks to Salome Oehler for 
providing scripts and datasets)
* Regression: The changes in the last version led to unexpected function behaviour in cases where 
users tried the fading correction with only a few dose points in the lower part of the dose-response curve because
the fits were no longer forced through the origin. This issue is now corrected, and the user 
can use the argument `fit.force_through_origin` (which is passed down to `plot_GrowthCurve()`) to force
the fit again through the origin (thanks to Junjie Zhang for reporting the issue).

### `read_BIN2R()`
* Argument `n.records` can now be provided as a vector to specifically 
select records for the import. All other records are skipped and not imported. 
This can be useful in particular for very large BIN/BINX-files because
allows importing single records very quickly without parsing the entire 
file
* The function learned about `RECTYPE` 128 records and can now import
them (before those records were skipped). As it is in the original format, these information are only appended to the BIN/BINX file, means they do not really represent measurement data. 

### `read_XSYG2R()`
* Tries a little bit harder to determine the correct file path.
* Returns the file path as `@info` object in the `RLum.Analysis-class` output.

### `plot_DetPlot()`
* The legend displayed the wrong labels for the equivalent dose and the `Ln/Tn` values; fixed.
* The legend is now disabled by default if no shine-down curve is shown; it can be activated again 
manually using `legend`.

### `plot_GrowthCurve()`
* Edge case: If the `Ln/Tn` values was way below the fit and `fit.method = EXP` was chosen for the fitting,
the function still returned a positive equivalent dose for `mode = interpolation`. Now the returned value
is `NA` since no interpolation was possible.
* Minor graphical polish: the dashed lines are drawn to the end of the plot area. 

### `plot_RLum()`
* The function knows how to process results produces by `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`, `analyse_pIRIRSequence()` and `analyse_IRSARRF()`; 
the functionality is very basic and for fast reporting situations only.

### `report_RLum()`
* The file `*.Rds` file path download did not function anymore; fixed.
* The function threw an non-conclusive warning; fixed. 

### `Risoe.BINfileData-class()`
* The `show` method now knows about `RECTYPE` 128 and will account for it.

### `Risoe.BINFfileData2RLum.Analysis()` 
* The function learned about `RECTYPE` 128 records. Those records contain ROI 
data from camera measurements and are skipped for the moment because they do not 
really belong to measurement data. This may change future.
