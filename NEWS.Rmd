# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

## New functions

* `remove_SignalBackground()`: A user-friendly method to subtract background signals 
from various curves in `RLum.Analysis-class` objects without resorting to `lapply()` 
loops. Depending on the record type, the function identifies pairs of curves; 
for instance, if in a sequence, a `TL` curve is followed immediately by another 
`TL` curve. The subsequent curve is recognised as the background signal, 
subtracted using `merge_RLum()` and subsequently removed from the object (if desired). 
Alternatively, a set of potential background curves can be specified. 

* `remove_RLum()`: This function further completes the set of methods that can handle 
and modify `RLum-class` objects. It operates on `RLum.Analysis-class` objects or a `list` 
of such objects to remove unwanted records from datasets. Although the function 
calls `get_RLum()` and relies on its functionality, the new implementation 
facilitates a more logical workflow and analysis pipeline. 

## Renamed functions and deprecations

## Breaking changes

* Function `get_Quote()` is no longer exported, but remains available as an
internal function. This is unlikely to affect any user of the package, as the
function was only meant to report a random quote at startup (#644).

* In the functions `fit_DoseResponseCurve()` and `plot_GrowthCurve()`, the `fit.method`
option `LambertW` was replaced by the more correct term `OTOR`. Nothing else has changed; 
however, if you run `fit.method = 'LambertW'`, it fails because it has to read `fit.method = 'OTOR'`.
The function does not throw a warning or message for this change because the option was likely 
not yet used much. 

* The fundamental physical constants used in the package (such as Boltzmann
constant, Planck constant, etc.) have been uniformed to those reported in the
[NIST Reference on Constants, Units and Uncertainty](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/).
This may affect the numerical results of the following functions:
`calc_FastRatio()`, `calc_Huntley2006()`, `calc_SourceDoseRate()`,
`calc_ThermalLifetime()`, `convert_Activity2Concentration()`,
`convert_Wavelength2Energy()`, `fit_CWCurve()`, `fit_LMCurve()`,
`fit_SurfaceExposure()`, `fit_ThermalQuenching()` (#693).

## Bugfixes and changes

### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()` 
* The function crashed if the number of `Lx` and `Tx` curves was not equal
when `structure = c("Lx", "Tx")`, which is the default. The check that the
number of points within each pair of curves has also been improved, and the
function now produces more helpful error messages (#616).
* The function tests are now less rigorous for different `Lx` and `Tx` sizes. While 
they should match, numerical rounding issues in the data returned by the measurement
devices could result in a rejection of records, although this has not actually any meaning 
for the data analysis, means, it should not fail.

### `analyse_portableOSL()`

* The function now returns an error if `mode` is something other than
`"profile"` or `"surface"`.

* The `mode` argument was not respected when operating over a list of objects
(#673).

* The function crashed when using `mode = "surface"` if the plotting limits
were too tight and left only one point (#675).

* The check on the validity of the `signal.integral` argument has been improved,
and now it occurs only once, so at most one warning is raised if the argument is
set to a value exceeding the valid range (#678, #680).

* The function returns a clearer message when no x-coordinates were measured
and `mode = "surface"` was used (#682).

* The `cex` and `type` graphical parameters can now configured via the `...`
argument (#684).

* The expected sequence pattern of the input object is validated more
thoroughly to avoid crashes in case of misspecification (#687).

* The graphical `...` argument `contour` never produced a meaningful contour plot
due to an internal error (#686). Along, arguments `contour_nlevels` and
`contour_col` are now supported through `...` to better control the number
and colour of contour lines.

### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`

* Add support for `fit.method = 'OTORX'` following the changes in
`fit_DoseResponseCurve()`; this change includes the new argument
`dose.points.test` that is only of use in combination with the `OTORX` fit.

### `calc_AliquotSize()`

* The new argument `sample_carrier.diameter` allows to specify a value for
the diameter of the sample carrier, which up to now was hardcoded to the very
common 9.8 mm size (#623).

* Several graphical parameters can now configured via `...` arguments, so
that the plot appearance can be fully customized (#671).

### `calc_AverageDose()`

* A bug in the implementation prevented the default plot settings from
being modified via `...` as advertised. Now custom settings are respected
(#658).

### `calc_FiniteMixture()`

* The function doesn't crash anymore if the `n.components` argument specifies
non-consecutive values (#691).

* The function sometimes failed to plot some of the densities when the number
of components was set to a value of 8 or more (#704).

* The density plots would not always be coloured completely, but especially
for high values of `sigmab` there would be an unfilled area at the base of the
densities (#706).

* If the very first iteration over the components during plotting was skipped,
then the function crashed as a quantity computed only in that iteration was
not available. This happened for very specific combinations of `sigmab` and
`n.components` (#708).

* Another crash occurred when height of the largest density curve could not
be estimated due to the presence of too many `NA` values in the intermediate
computations (#710).

* The check for significance of each component added to the model has been
corrected to be more statistically rigorous (#703).

* Blank gaps appearing to the sides of the proportion of components plot
for high number of components have been removed (#713), as well as extra
slices appearing due to rounding errors (#715).

* The plot can be better configured via the new `plot.criteria` argument to
control whether the statistical criteria curves should be drawn. Moreover,
support for the `...` options has been added: `cex` to control the overall
scaling, `main.densities`, `main.proportions` and `main.criteria` to set the
subplot titles (#717).

* Plots are now generated even when results contain `NA` values, as they in
general don't affect the plot. However, when that happens we report it in the
plot subtitle (#718).

### `calc_Huntley2006()`

* Support was added for multicore computations via the `cores` argument, and
for the nls-fitting control options `maxiter` and `trace`.

* The fitting of the simulated curve with the GOK model has been made more
robust: when an initial fit of the model fails, the fit is attempted again
with 10 different values for `D0` and the best fit is used. This should
reduce the number of occasions in which the error message "Could not fit
simulated model curve, check suitability of model and parameters" is
reported (#660).

* The function crashed if all simulated Lx/Tx values were identical and
approximately zero, which could happen if the `rhop` argument was set to a
large enough value (#725).

* An error message has been improved so that it doesn't suggest setting the
'fit.bounds = FALSE' argument if it has already been set (#729).

* The computation of the x-axis limits has been improved to avoid having too
much unused horizontal space, especially for `mode = "extrapolation"` (#731).

* The scaling of the plot can now be controlled via the `cex` argument (#735).

* The plot margins are set more precisely and avoid the summary text to be
cut off (#737).

### `calc_MinDose()`

* The function now warns if the number of bootstrap replicates is too low to
perform the loess fitting (#721).

### `calc_OSLLxTxRatio()`
* The function returned a warning for wrong integral settings for the `Tx` curve even if no `Tx` curve was provided; fixed. 
* The function does not check any more of different object types for `Lx.data` and `Tx.data` but validate objects for allowed types (this should have no user-visible effects)

### `convert_Concentration2DoseRate()`

* The function validates its input values more thoroughly (#613).

### `extract_IrradiationTimes()`

* The function tries a little bit harder to extract the correct duration of 
TL steps, rendering the data output hopefully a little bit more intelligible (#651).  
* The function gained a new argument called `return_same_as_input`. If set to `TRUE`, 
the input object, usually an `RLum.Analysis-class` object or a `list` of it, is returned
but comes with updated info elements for `IRR_TIME` and `TIMESINCEIRR`. This makes the 
`RLum.Analysis-class` object compatible with functions that explicitly search for 
those two objects, such as we have them in the `'OSLdecomposition'` package (#752).

### `fit_DoseResponseCurve()`

* The function now allocates less memory for storing intermediate values
(#610).
* Add initial support for `OTORX` fitting following Lawless and Timar-Gabor (2024) (#677). 
The code implementation follows the Python reference by [jll2](https://github.com/jll2/LumDRC/blob/main/otorx.py)
with an addition for an allowed offset parameter `a` set if `fit.force_through_origin = FALSE`. This also enables 
the support of `mode = "extrapolation"` (thanks to John Lawless for his input).
* The code of the function was optimised in several places to improve code readability and 
reduce redundant calls.
* The models for `EXP`, `EXP+LIN`, `EXP+EXP` and `GOK` are now available in 
C++. This cut the required computation times in half in benchmark scenarios. More importantly, 
this performance scales with the number of Monte Carlo runs. 

### `fit_SurfaceExposure()`

* It is now possible to specify different values for the light attenuation
coefficient `mu` when a list of input data is provided (#667).

### `fit_ThermalQuenching()`

* The `trace` option, which can be specified via the `method_control`
argument, is now respected.

* The model now get internally reformulated into a mathematically equivalent
expression that is easier to fit. This should reduce the number of occasions
when the function fails to find a valid solution and improve the uncertainty
estimation (#696).

### `import_Data()`

* The function uses the most common formats (BINX and XSYG) before trying
all others.

### `merge_RLum.Data.Curve()`

* The function does no longer stops for differing channel resolutions, 
but it does issue a warning. The user is responsible for the consequences.

### `plot_DetPlot()`

* The logic for multicore support was incorrect, which resulted in always
starting a parallel cluster even when `multicore = FALSE` (#742).

### `plot_DoseResponseCurve()`

* The response curve always tries to the get the 0 point in the mode `interpolation` and `alternate` (#677)

### `plot_DRCSummary()`

* Add support for `fit.method = 'OTORX'` following the change in `fit_DoseResponseCurve()` (#677)

### `plot_GrowthCurve()`

* Add support for `OTORX` fit corresponding to the underlying change in `fit_DoseReponseCurve()` (#677)

### `plot_Histogram()`

* The function now doesn't produce warnings when the input consists of a
single-column data frame, as it assumes that the De error is 10^-9 (#744).

* The right margin is now smaller when errors are not plotted, as there is
no need to leave space for the standard error axis (#748).

* The summary text now scales better at non-default cex settings (#750).

### `plot_KDE()`

* The function validates its input values more thoroughly (#635).

* Setting `summary.pos` to one of "left", "center" or "right" resulted in
the summary table not being visible (#642).

* Argument `output` has been removed, and it will be ignored if set (#700).

### `plot_RadialPlot()`

* The function validates its input values more thoroughly (#639).

* The legend text now scales better at non-default cex settings (#746).

### `plot_RLum.Data.Curve()`

* We added comprehensive support for base R plotting arguments utilised by `plot.default()` and `par()`. 
This enhancement ensures that all available arguments are fully supported (#646).

* The function gained a new logical argument named `auto_scale`. When set in conjunction with either `xlim` or `ylim`, this argument automatically adjusts the plot range to align with the corresponding settings for `xlim` or `ylim`. For instance, if a user intends to plot OSL curves but initially selects the `xlim` range `c(10:30)` to examine the background, the initial count values may be excessively large, resulting in limited visibility. With the introduction of the `auto_scale` option, the `ylim` values are automatically adjusted to compensate for this scenario. The `auto_scale` argument is also accessible through `plot_RLum.Analysis()` and `plot_RLum()` (#646).

### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`

* The channel-wise background subtraction was essentially broken if a
background spectrum with the same setting was provided. The function always
calculated the arithmetic mean. This was fixed, and the manual updated
accordingly.

* If a background spectrum was provided, the behaviour of the plot output was
sometimes hard to understand without knowledge of the underlying code. This
behaviour was improved and now `ylim` will also affect the background spectrum
if `bg.channels = NULL` (the default).

* The function could crash if column names were missing and the 1bg.spectrum`
argument was used (#726).

###`read_TIFF2R()`

* The argument `file` can now be provided as a `list` or a character vector.

* The function gained a new logical argument called `merge2stack` that can be used
if `file` is either a `list` or a character vector of length > 1. If set to `TRUE`, 
images are combined into one image stack.

### `read_XSYG2R()`

* A redundant computation has been removed, and the function is now marginally
faster on files when the detector is not a spectrometer (#753).

### `scale_GammaDose()`

* Argument `plot_singlePanels` now works as documented, that is it produces
all plots in a single page when set to `FALSE` (default), and one plot per
page when set to `TRUE` (#698).

### `sort_RLum()`
* The sorting mechanism for `RLum.Analysis-class` objects has been enhanced. 
It now enables sorting based on multiple parameters, including sorting all 
available `info_elements` in a prioritised manner (#606, #620).
* Sorting now works on a list of `RLum.Analysis-class` objects. If the list contains other elements, 
they are passed through. The output is again a list (#620) 

### `structure_RLum()`

* The function now returns a less messy data frame because it encapsulates
`.pid` and `info` as lists within the data frame. The function is primarily
used internally to facilitate a rapid exploration of `RLum.Analysis-class`
object structures. However, the change may potentially break existing code in
extremely rare circumstances.

### `verify_SingleGrainData()`

* The function crashed if an object originating from `read_XSYG2R()` contained
positions in its `info` field (#740).

### `write_R2TIFF()`

* The function now supports the export of more than one image slice. 

## Internals

* The internal function `create_UID()` has undergone further optimisation for speed, 
resulting in a significant performance improvement. Additionally, it now generates 
a hash value with a consistent length instead of a time stamp with a random number.
