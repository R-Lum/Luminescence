# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.1**

## Bugfixes and changes

### `convert_PSL2CSV()` 
* The function still contained a bug if the parameters were combined in a certain way; fixed.

### `merge_RisoeBINfileData()` 
* Does not anymore throw an error if the number of input objects was smaller than two. It just passes the input through unchanged.

### `plot_DetPlot()` 
* The function now returns a clear error message if the input object is not of type `RLum.Analysis`
* Edge case: the function does not crash anymore if used in a loop and if all equivalent doses were `NA`; 
it sill throws warnings though. (thanks to Annette Kadereit for reporting)

### `write_RLum2CSV()`
* The behaviour of the parameter `prefix` caused confusion, because in combination with multiple files the function 
overwrote created files, although this was wanted behaviour now the prefix is always added to the automatically created files names.
