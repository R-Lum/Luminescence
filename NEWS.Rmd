# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.2**

## Bugfixes and changes

### `read_BIN2R()`
* Argument `n.records` can now be provided as a vector to specifically 
select records for the import. All other records are skipped and not imported. 
This can be useful in particular for very large BIN/BINX-files because
allows importing single records very quickly without parsing the entire 
file
