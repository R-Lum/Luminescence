NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.4.0 (XX XXXX, 2014):

  New S4-classes, methods:

         • ‘RLum.Data.Image’: S4-class for handling image data
           including. Image data in slot ‘data’ are stored as
           ‘RasterBrick’

         • ‘RLum.Results’: homogenised structure for containing the
           following base items in the slot data: 'summary', 'args' and
           'call'. Where applicable the 'data' slot contains the
           original input data.  Depending on the function various
           further slots are added containing additional (intermediate)
           data and objects,

         • ‘set_RLum.Data.Image()’: Set method for class
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’

         • ‘get_RLum.Data.Image()’: get method for class
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’

         • further: corresponding show and coercing methods added for
           class ‘RLum.Data.Image’.

  New functions:

         • ‘analyse_pIRIRSequence()’: Function to analyse post-IR IRSL
           sequence measurements (#133),

         • ‘calc_MinDose()’: the previous ‘calc_MinDose3()’ and
           ‘calc_MinDose4()’ functions were merged to the new
           ‘calc_MinDose()’ function, which was rewritten from scratch
           and now contains both the 3- and 4-parametric Minimum Age
           Models (introducing the new argument ‘par’).  Detailed
           changes and bugfixes are listed further below,

         • ‘calc_MaxDose()’: a wrapper function that calls
           ‘calc_MinDose()’, but transforms the data set similar to the
           method described in Olley et al. (2006).  Rather than
           estimating the minimum dose of a De distribution, this
           function estimates the maximum dose.

         • ‘get_Layout()’: Helper function to return a list with layout
           definitions for more homogenous plotting,

         • ‘get_RLum()’: Wrapper function for various get methods for
           ‘RLum’-objects (#148),

         • ‘merge_RLum.Analysis()’: Function allows merging of
           RLum.Analysis objects and adding of objects an RLum.Analysis
           object consists of (#138),

         • ‘merge_RLum()’: Wrapper function for various merge methods
           for ‘RLum’-objects (#139),

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Image()’: Plot function for
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’ object.  Function also added to wrapper
           function ‘plot_RLum’,

         • ‘plot_RLum.Results()’: Plot function for ‘RLum.Results’
           objects.  RLum.Results objects created, e.g. by the age
           model functions may now be passed to ‘plot_RLum.Results()’
           to create specific plots that previously were generated by
           the functions themselves.  Function also added to wrapper
           function ‘plot_RLum’,

         • ‘readSPE2R()’: Add support Princenton Instruments *.SPE
           files (camera and spectrometer measurements). Function
           output is a ‘RLum.Data.Spectrum’ or ‘RLum.Data.Image’
           object.

  New example data sets:

         • ‘ExampleData.RLum.Data.Image’: Example data for
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’ object (part of #135).

  Changes S4-objects, methods, classes:

         • ‘get_RLum.Analysis()’: Add support for inverse ‘record.id’
           selection, e.g. ‘record.id = -1’ selects all objects except
           the first.

         • ‘get_RLum.Results()’:

             • Add support for data objects for objects produced by the
               function ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’,

             • match access behavoir of objects produced by the
               function ‘calc_TLLxTxRatio()’. Now it works similar to
               the function ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’.

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Analysis()’: If the ‘pos’ value is
           invalid now the function does not return an error any
           longer. Instead ‘NA’ is returned.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’:

             • Add ‘...’ support for ‘mtext’,

             • argument ‘method’ added to allow selection between the
               method ‘"FIT"’ and ‘"SLIDE"’. The latter method has been
               newly implemented (#143).

         • ‘analyse_SAR.CWOSL()’:

             • Allow 'IRSL' curves as input to support rough data
               analysis of the post-IR IRSL protocol (#132, Alice
               Versendaal, #140, Georgina King),

             • support multiple recuperation measurements,

             • correct wrong TL curve figure scaling,

             • argument ‘log’ moved to the ‘...’ argument,

             • correct wrong regeneration point numbering (#144),

             • arguments ‘cex’, ‘main’ now supported via the ‘...’
               argument,

             • argument ‘mtext.outer’ added,

             • output object ‘Formula’ added to return the fromula of
               the growth curve,

             • output object ‘De.values’ extended for D01, D02 and
               information on the applied fittin,

             • numerical output extended for information on the choosen
               signal and background integration limits (#122),

             • enhance argument ‘output.plot.single’ for numerical
               values.  This allows to select each single plot output
               individually,

             • details from the argument ‘rejection.criteria’ were
               removed from the argument list to allow a more flexible
               handling (e.g. changing only one parameter at time) and
               to clean up the argument list. However, the argument
               work still as excpected (#145),

             • reformat of rejection criteria output to allow easier
               further treatment,

             • support graphical output of rejection criteria and IRSL
               curve (if exists),

             • minor bug fixes (e.g., not properly caluculated TL curve
               resolution) and graphical adjustements.

         • ‘Analyse_SAR.OSLdata()’:

             • Error message implemented for non OSL data sets (#130,
               Georgina King),

             • Added argument ‘dtype’ to provide further curve
               limitation options,

             • minor code polishing.

         • ‘calc_AliquotSize()’:

             • new argument ‘plot’ (logical): option to (dis-)allow
               plotting of the Monte Carlo estimation,

             • argument ‘MC.estimate’ was renamed to ‘MC’,

             • new structure of the returned ‘RLum.Results’ object,
               containing the elements 'summary', 'args', 'call' and

             • new structure of the returned ‘RLum.Results’ object,
               containing the elemennts 'summary', 'data', 'args',
               'call' and 'profile',

             • fixed a bug that occured for non-dispersed data sets and
               resulted in a virtually infinite loop using up all
               available memory,

             • plotting now done by

               'call'.

         • ‘calc_MaxDose3()’:

             • Function renamed to ‘calc_MaxDose()’,

             • this is now just a wrapper function that calls the new
               ‘calc_MinDose()’ function, but transforms the data set
               similar to the method described in Olley et al. (2006).
               For further details please see the changes/bugfixes for

               Age Model should be applied,

             • new argument ‘bootstrap’ (logical) to apply the recycled
               bootstrap approach of Cunningham & Wallinga (2012),

             • new argument ‘boundaries’ that accepts a named list

             • new argument ‘'...'’ that, amongst others, checks for
               ‘debug’ (logical) and ‘verbose’ (logical) to (dis-)allow

             • function now iteratively adjusts boundaries for sigma
               when the estimator reaches the upper boundary,

             • function now tries to estimate reasonable starting
               values for all parameters,

             • calculation and plotting of the maximum log likelihood
               functions/profiles are now done using the mle2()
               function of the 'bbmle' package

             • the optimisation routine was changed from 'nlminb' to
               'optim' using the 'L-BFGS-B' method,

             • confidence intervals for all parameters are now
               calculated by the 'confint()' method and exclusively on
               the 95% confidence level

             • the asymmetric error on gamma (i.e., the minimum dose)
               is now exclusively determined on the 95% confidence
               interval of the profile log likelihood function for
               gamma

             • a symmetric standard error for gamma is automatically
               derived from the 95% confidence interval of the profile
               log likelihood function by dividing the length of this
               interval by 3.92 (see Galbraith & Roberts, 2012).

             • new structure of the returned ‘RLum.Results’ object,

               'call', 'mle', 'BIC', 'confint', 'profile', 'bootstrap',

             • plotting now done by ‘plot_RLum.Results()’.

               curve errors for rare combinations of signal and
               background integreation limits,

             • provide a name for the output data frame ‘LxTx.table’
               for the ‘RLum.Results’ object,

             • error fixed for the marginal case that k = 2 and exceed

               error was calculated,

             • argument ‘sigmab’ was listed but was so far not
               implement. Fixed (#166)

             • support of data without given uncertainties.

         • ‘calc_Statistics()’:

             • support of data with ‘NA’ or zero errors

         • ‘calc_TLLxTxRatio()’:

             • Lx/Tx ratio wrongly calculated as due to a coding error
               just the first value of the signal integral was taken
               for summing up the values and not the range of the
               values,

             • Output produced by the function now is a ‘list’ (data
               slot in the RLum object), to equal behavoir of the
               functions.

         • ‘fit_CWCurve()’:

             • Implement ‘...’ argument to replace explicit arguments
               ‘ylab’, ‘xlab’ and ‘main’,

             • Fix an issue that causes an error when input values were
               <= 0 (#123 reported by Johanna Lomax),

             • Correct wrong y-axis labelling (wrong channel resolution
               value).

         • ‘plot_AbanicoPlot()’:

             • numeric values allowed for parameter centrality,

               (#154),

             • support of ‘par(mfcol())’.

         • ‘plot_DRTResults()’:

             • Argument ‘na.exclude’ renamed to ‘na.rm’,

             • by default ylim scaling now is set to the minimum and
               maximum extend of the data set,

             • argument ‘given.dose’ now allows a vector as input,
               e.g., if more then one data set is provided (#156),

             • argument ‘given.dose’ are not required any longer
               (became an optional argument).  With this the plot
               function can be easily re-used, e.g. for preheat plateau
               tests,

             • change behaviour of the argument ‘na.rm’. If a data set
               is provided containing ‘NA’ values also the
               corresponding values in provided by the argument
               ‘preheat’ are cleaned up. This allows a proper usage of
               the function in combination with grouping option (e.g.,
               ‘boxplot = TRUE’.

             • minor corrections in error handling and graphical
               appearance.

             • support of data without and ‘NA’-values for error values
               (#152, #162),

             • implementation of ‘calc_Stats()’-call for extended
               statistic summary,

             • support of summary keywords "kurtosis" and "skewness"

         • ‘plot_KDE()’:

             • wrong x-axis and y-axis limit calculation fixed (#158),

             • renaming and extension of summary and ‘summary.pos’
               parameter,

             • plot now longer shows a density error when no error
               exists (#160),

             • support of ‘par(mfcol())’.

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’:

             • Minor graphical and code polishing,

             • fix wrong regneration point plotting, if sequence
               contains more then one zero dose point,

             • argument ‘na.exclude’ for the sake consistency replaced
               by ‘na.rm’,

             • proper error message provided if nothing is left after
               ‘NA’ value removal,

             • overshoot of normal distribution curve in MC simulation
               plot corrected (#111),

             • argument ‘output.plotExtended.single’ added allowing a
               single window plot output of all plots,

             • formula of the fitted function is now returend as R
               expression instead of a ‘formula’ object. The return
               object remains, however, ‘Formula’,

             • correct wrong error message and graphical output for
               cases where no De can be calculated for Ln/Tn values
               much higher than the highest Lx/Tx value,

             • fix ‘'EXP+EXP'’ fit as is was broken, due to a coding
               error,

             • minor code polishing and adjustment.

         • ‘plot_RLum.Analysis()’:

             • Add argument ‘abline’ to allow inserting similar
               vertical or horizontal lines in every plot. The decision
               to implement this argument in this function instead the
               function ‘plot_RLum.Data.Curve()’ was made because in a
               single plot modus ‘abline’ is more sufficiently used as
               separat function call,

             • now reset ‘par’ parameters suffciently,

             • add argument ‘combine’ to allow fast combining of curves
               in single plot window.

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Curve()’:

             • Add argument ‘norm’ to allow for curve normalisation to
               the highest value (#129),

             • Correct for insufficient information on the channel
               resolution when data was imported from an XSYG file.

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()’:

             • Correct an error that caused a chrash when ‘xlim’ was
               set in a way that only one wavelength (colour value) was
               remained,

             • correct zebra-colour-pattern for rare cases of ‘xlim’
               settings using ‘plot.type = "persp"’ or ‘plot.type =
               "persp3d"’,

             • add argument new plot type ‘"transect"’ for plotting a
               transect along the time/temperature axis for a specific
               wavelength/channel intervall (#120, requested by Regina
               DeWitt),

             • correct function break for a single column matrix
               (single frame spectrum) by automatically resetting
               ‘plot.type’ to ‘single’ for single frame spectra,

             • colour rug (‘rug = TRUE’) implemented for plot type
               ‘"multiple.lines"’ (#130),

             • argument ‘xaxis.energy’ for wavelength energy conversion
               for 2D plots added (#141).

         • ‘readBIN2R()’:

             • Integrity checks added to avoid unspecific errors for
               wrong input formats.

         • ‘readXSYG2R()’:

             • If the stimulator is infrared light the ‘recordType’
               will be set to ‘IRSL’. This makes the curve types more
               consistent with the commonly applied nomenclature,

             • now the function automatically converts time values to
               temperature values also for spectra data (#121);
               behavious is triggered with the argument
               ‘recalculate.TL.curves’

  Internals:

         • Add new dependency for package ‘raster’ and ‘sp’, which is
           used for the ‘RLum.Data.Image-class’,

         • dependency to package 'Rserve' removed,

         • dependcy to package 'zoo' added (used for running means),

         • dependency to package 'bbmle' added (used for maximum
           likelihood estimations).
