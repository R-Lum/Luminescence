NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.4.2 (March 23th 2015):

  New functions:

         • ‘calc_IEU()’: Apply the internal-external-uncertainty (IEU)
           model after Thomsen et al. (2007) to a given De distribution

         • ‘extract_IrradiationTimes()’: Extract irradiation times from
           an XSYG file

  Changes S4-objects, methods, classes:

         • ‘RLum.Analysis-class’:

             • Fix: Argument ‘keep.object == TRUE’ was not respected
               for the case after using the function
               ‘get_RLum.Analysis()’ the object just contained a single
               object. In such cases only the object itself, but no
               ‘RLum.Analysis’ object was returned (#200).

         • ‘RisoeBINfileData-class’:

             • Slot ‘.RESERVED’ added to allow transfering undocumented
               raw binary values to a new BIN/BINX-file. For this all
               reserved bytes are just copied and pasted into the new
               slot ‘.RESERVED’ using the function ‘readBIN2R()’. Using
               the function ‘writeR2BIN()’ transfers the values
               unchanged to the new BIN/BINX-file. Allc corresponding
               functions have been updated in accordance
               (‘readBIN2R()’, ‘writeR2BIN()’ and
               ‘merge_Risoe.BINfileData()’. Other functions are not
               affected as they can simply ignore the new slot.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’

             • Function now checks the number of channels in each
               curve. If the number of the channels in the first curve
               is > than in the 2nd curve the execution of the function
               is stopped,

             • add error estimation using bootstraping and MC loops for
               ‘method = "SLIDE"’,

             • add scaled KDE for distribution of De,

             • the functions no longer stops with an error if a
               undefined ‘method’ was choosen. Instead a warning
               message is shown and the available curves are shown in a
               plot anyway,

             • the labelling for the residuals is replaced by a greek
               letter (epsilon, ‘"\u03b5"’),

             • new argument ‘rejection.criteria’ provided to allow for
               setting rejection criteria. The argument works similar
               as for other ‘analyse_...’ functions. Details are
               provided in the manual,

             • speed up caculation time for ‘method = "SLIDE"’ by
               re-writting the sliding process as C++ function. It does
               not the affect readability of the R-code at all, as just
               the sum of the residual squares is calculated in this
               way, i.e. the steps are simple, but now much faster.

         • ‘analyse_SAR.CWOSL()’

             • For the case that no recycling ratio and no recuperation
               rate could be calculated the functions chrashed. This
               has bee corrected.

         • ‘analyse_pIRIRSequence()’

             • For the case that no recycling ratio and no recuperation
               rate could be calculated the functions chrashed. This
               has bee corrected; in accordance with the similar
               behaviour in the function analyse_SAR.CWOSL().

         • ‘calc_FadingCorr()’

             • Change the way the equation is solved using the R
               function ‘uniroot’. This markedly speeds up the
               computation process,

             • now additionally an ‘RLum.Results’ object is returned,

             • minor code polishing.

         • ‘calc_MinDose()’

             • Major changes in terms of reliablity and perfomance to
               the optimisation of the log likelihood function. Amongst
               minor fixes these include:

             • Optimiser of the log likelihood function changed from
               'optim' to 'nlminb' and switch from 'L-BFGS-B' method to
               default PORT routine,

             • Removed parameter: ‘boundaries’

             • Boundaries for the model parameters are now hard-coded
               and suffice all input data,

             • Warning messages are now suppressed unless ‘debug=TRUE’,

             • Improved error handling and fallback for profiling the
               log likelihood function,

             • Start value for gamma and mu are changed to lower
               quartile of the dose values,

             • fixed an error in the documentation that prevented the
               'value' section from being displayed

             • additional information on bootstrapping added in
               'details' section,

             • new example added,

             • add multicore support for bootstrapping,

             • new arguments: ‘multicore’ (logical), ‘cores’ (numeric).

         • ‘calc_Statistics()’

             • argument ‘na.rm’ added (#198).

         • ‘CW2pHMi()’

             • Functions was rather inflexible selecting the allowed
               curves, e.g. ‘"OSL"’ worked, ‘"OSL (UVVIS)"’ not.
               Corrected.

         • ‘CW2pLMi()’

             • Functions was rather inflexible selecting the allowed
               curves, e.g. ‘"OSL"’ worked, ‘"OSL (UVVIS)"’ not.
               Corrected.

         • ‘CW2pLM()’

             • Functions was rather inflexible selecting the allowed
               curves, e.g. ‘"OSL"’ worked, ‘"OSL (UVVIS)"’ not.
               Corrected.

         • ‘CW2pPMi()’

             • Functions was rather inflexible selecting the allowed
               curves, e.g. ‘"OSL"’ worked, ‘"OSL (UVVIS)"’ not.
               Corrected.

         • ‘merge_Risoe.BINfileData()’

             • Support for the changes in the corresponding S4-class
               are implemented.

         • ‘plot_AbanicoPlot()’

             • Missing summary keywords ‘"kdemax"’, ‘"skewness"’ and
               ‘"kurtosis"’ added (#205)

         • ‘plot_Histogram()’

             • Missing summary keywords ‘"kdemax"’, ‘"skewness"’ and
               ‘"kurtosis"’ added (#205)

         • ‘plot_KDE()’

             • Missing summary keywords ‘"kdemax"’, ‘"skewness"’ and
               ‘"kurtosis"’ added (#205)

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’

             • Fix an error that causes a function chrash if the input
               data.frame (argument ‘sample’) comprises row names. Now
               all preset row names are removed automatically,

             • using the option ‘fit.weights = FALSE’ in combination
               with ‘fit.method = "LIN"’ caused an error. Corrected,

             • avoid confusing warning messages in case ‘fit.weights’
               was set to ‘FALSE’,

             • fix an error that causes a chrash for the combination
               ‘fit.method = "LIN"’ and error column just comprises 0,

             • argument ‘main’ was not working as expected, corrected.
               Furthermore the argument is removed from the argument
               list, but is still available via ‘...’,

             • the slow self-written approach to calculate the De for
               ‘fit.method = "EXP+LIN"’ and ‘fit.method = "EXP+EXP"’
               has been replaced by the function ‘uniroot’. This
               markedly reduces the computation times for the MC
               simulation (partly addresses issue #100)

         • ‘plot_RadialPlot()’

             • Missing summary keywords ‘"kdemax"’, ‘"skewness"’ and
               ‘"kurtosis"’ added (#205)

         • ‘plot_RLum.Analysis()’

             • Fix an error appeared for ‘combine = TRUE’ if only one
               single object was in the ‘RLum.Analysis’ object (#199),

             • added logical argument ‘plot.single’. In fact this just
               resets ‘ncols’ and ‘nrows’ to ‘1’ (#201),

             • added argument ‘curve.transformation’ to allow a quick
               dataoverview using the pseudo-LM curve transformation
               methods.

         • ‘plot_RLum.Results()’

             • Improved error handling for ‘RLum.Results’ objects
               originating from ‘calc_MinDose()’

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()’

             • For ‘plot.type="multiple.lines"’ the legend was placed
               odd, corrected using ‘par()$usr’ parameters,

             • argument ‘legend.text’ added for plot types which
               support a legend (e.g., ‘plot.type="multiple.lines"’).

         • ‘readBIN2R()’

             • Improved handling of odd time formats,

             • support for the changes in the corresponding S4-class
               implemented.

         • ‘writeR2BIN()’

             • Part of the manual was missing due to an error in the
               inlinedoc documentation. Fixed.,

             • the argument ‘version’ no expects a ‘character’ as impot
               instead of a ‘raw’ object,

             • further suppressing of confusing warning messages,

             • date has not been written properly in accordance with
               the format description (fixed),

             • time values have been not properly exported in same
               cases, corrected.

             • added support for changes in corresponding S4-class,
               means that reserved values are transfered,

             • the version conversion was partly broken due to the new
               routines implemented with last update (fixed),

             • if empty comments or sample names are provided these are
               replaced by ‘" "’ (double empty space),

             • if the BIN-file is stored in a different version, the
               version number and the record lengths are now changed
               accordingly.

  New example data sets:

         • ExampleData.DeValues is now a list with two elements
           containing an additional single grain quartz data set (#203)

  Internals:

         • Adding dependency for package 'Rcpp'. This is used in
           particular to export some time consuming calculations to
           compiled C++ code to speed up the functions. Currently it is
           used e.g. in the function ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’,

         • adding dependency (import) for the packages ‘parallel’. With
           this the multicore support is realised within in the
           package. First implemented in the function ‘calc_MinDose()’.

Changes in version 0.4.1 (January 29th, 2015):

  New functions:

         • ‘merge_RLum.Data.Curve()’: Function allows merging of
           ‘RLum.Data.Curve’ objects in different ways (#128).

  Changes S4-objects, methods, classes:

         • ‘RLum.Analysis-class’:

             • Show warnings messages when empty object are produced by
               a ‘get_RLum.Analysis()’ request (implemented in get
               method and show method).

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_SAR.CWOSL()’

             • rename argument ‘output.plot’ to ‘plot’,

             • rename argument ‘output.plot.single’ to ‘plot.single’,

             • rejection criteria added 'De > max. dose point'. These
               avoids that values are accepted even the De from the
               fitting should be considered as invalid.

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’

             • Add enhanced support for ‘...’, e.g. ‘log’, ‘xlim’,
               ‘ylim’,

             • rename argument ‘output.plot’ to ‘plot’.

         • ‘analyse_pIRIRSequence()’

             • Fix an error that causes problems during plotting (Error
               in plot.new(): figure margins too large),

             • rename argument ‘output.plot’ to ‘plot’,

             • rename argument ‘output.plot.single’ to ‘plot.single’.

         • ‘merge_RLum()’: Function extended accordingly with the newly
           implemented function ‘merge_RLum.Data.Curve()’ (#128).

         • ‘plot_AbanicoPlot()’:

             • ticks removed from error bars,

             • line value output removed,

             • placement of y- and z-labels set to center of plot,

             • weights-option for KDE integrated,

             • warning for linear z-scale removed,

             • fixed an error that occured in Abanico Plot for a large
               data range (#188),

             • function output extended by data points in/out of
               confidence interval,

             • histogram option added,

             • dot plot option added,

             • KDE bandwidth added to plot output,

             • KDE bandwidth default changed to "SJ",

             • rugs coloured according to subsets,

             • examples section extended.

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’:

             • Thanks to a querry from Rachel Smedly (#194) the De
               error calculation method has been updated.  So far only
               the Lx/Tx values have been re-sampled using a Monte
               Carlo simlation approach to estimate the error. In
               contrast to the Analyst the Ln/Tn value was just
               considered without any error. This has been changed for
               all fitting methods and the final De error is calculated
               now also using the Ln/Tn error.  Note: Usually this
               change results in a larger De error, however this
               approach is much more realistic,

             • consequently to the changes made in the error
               calculation the corresponding De resulting from the MC
               simulation is now added to the output object
               (‘$De$De.MC’),

             • Ln/Tn point including the error is now added on the plot
               output as red circle,

             • fix a bug occasionally occurred for ‘fit.method =
               "EXP+EXP"’ and the function broke subsequently (#159).

         • ‘readBIN2R()’:

             • critical bug fixed: ‘GRAIN’ and ‘GRAINNUMBER’ were not
               imported properely (thanks to Norber Mercier),

             • import speed has been improved by at least an order of
               magnitude, due to a different internal data handling
               (using of ‘data.table’ instead of ‘data.frame’). This
               may become relevant for hugh BIN-files like they are
               produced by single grain measurements (#191).  Note: The
               ‘Risoe.BINfileData-class’ remained untouched.

         • ‘writeR2BIN()’:

             • minor changes due to the changes in the function
               ‘readBIN2R()’,

             • confusing warnings during writing are suppressed.

  Internals:

         • Add new dependency for package ‘data.table’ (used in the
           function ‘readBIN2R()’).

Changes in version 0.4.0 (December 19th, 2014):

  Preface:

         • Amongst a few minor changes with this release we continued
           the homogenisation process to further unify our function
           arguments.  So far meaningful similar function arguments can
           be used over all functions in the package to produce similar
           effects (e.g., na.rm = TRUE/FALSE). For you as package user
           it means that self-written R scripts using package functions
           are likely to break. Please check the list of changes below.

           We apologise for any inconvenience!

  New S4-classes, methods:

         • ‘RLum.Data.Image’: S4-class for handling image data
           including. Image data in slot ‘data’ are stored as
           ‘RasterBrick’

         • ‘RLum.Results’: homogenised structure for containing the
           following base items in the slot data: 'summary', 'args' and
           'call'. Where applicable the 'data' slot contains the
           original input data.  Depending on the function various
           further slots are added containing additional (intermediate)
           data and objects,

         • ‘set_RLum.Data.Image()’: Set method for class
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’

         • ‘get_RLum.Data.Image()’: get method for class
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’

         • further: corresponding show and coercing methods added for
           class ‘RLum.Data.Image’.

  New functions:

         • ‘analyse_pIRIRSequence()’: Function to analyse post-IR IRSL
           sequence measurements (#133),

         • ‘calc_MinDose()’: the previous ‘calc_MinDose3()’ and
           ‘calc_MinDose4()’ functions were merged to the new
           ‘calc_MinDose()’ function, which was rewritten from scratch
           and now contains both the 3- and 4-parametric Minimum Age
           Models (introducing the new argument ‘par’).  Detailed
           changes and bugfixes are listed further below,

         • ‘calc_MaxDose()’: a wrapper function that calls
           ‘calc_MinDose()’, but transforms the data set similar to the
           method described in Olley et al. (2006).  Rather than
           estimating the minimum dose of a De distribution, this
           function estimates the maximum dose.

         • ‘calc_SourceDoseRate()’: calculating the dose rate of the
           irradiation source at the date of measurement based on:
           source calibration date, source dose rate, dose rate error.

         • ‘get_Layout()’: Helper function to return a list with layout
           definitions for more homogenous plotting,

         • ‘get_RLum()’: Wrapper function for various get methods for
           ‘RLum’-objects (#148),

         • ‘merge_RLum.Analysis()’: Function allows merging of
           RLum.Analysis objects and adding of objects an RLum.Analysis
           object consists of (#138),

         • ‘merge_RLum()’: Wrapper function for various merge methods
           for ‘RLum’-objects (#139),

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Image()’: Plot function for
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’ object.  Function also added to wrapper
           function ‘plot_RLum’,

         • ‘plot_RLum.Results()’: Plot function for ‘RLum.Results’
           objects.  RLum.Results objects created, e.g. by the age
           model functions may now be passed to ‘plot_RLum.Results()’
           to create specific plots that previously were generated by
           the functions themselves.  Function also added to wrapper
           function ‘plot_RLum’,

         • ‘readSPE2R()’: Add support Princenton Instruments *.SPE
           files (camera and spectrometer measurements). Function
           output is a ‘RLum.Data.Spectrum’ or ‘RLum.Data.Image’
           object.

  New example data sets:

         • ‘ExampleData.RLum.Data.Image’: Example data for
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’ object (part of #135).

  Changes S4-objects, methods, classes:

         • ‘get_RLum.Analysis()’: Add support for inverse ‘record.id’
           selection, e.g. ‘record.id = -1’ selects all objects except
           the first.

         • ‘get_RLum.Results()’:

             • Add support for data objects for objects produced by the
               function ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’,

             • match access behavoir of objects produced by the
               function ‘calc_TLLxTxRatio()’. Now it works similar to
               the function ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’.

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData-class’: Description updated due to
           established changes made for a better file format support.

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Analysis()’: If the ‘pos’ value is
           invalid now the function does not return an error any
           longer. Instead ‘NA’ is returned.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’:

             • Add ‘...’ support for ‘mtext’,

             • argument ‘method’ added to allow selection between the

               newly implemented (#143).

         • ‘analyse_SAR.CWOSL()’:

             • Allow 'IRSL' curves as input to support rough data

             • details from the argument ‘rejection.criteria’ were
               removed from the argument list to allow a more flexible
               handling (e.g. changing only one parameter at time) and
               to clean up the argument list. However, the argument
               work still as excpected (#145),

             • reformat of rejection criteria output to allow easier
               further treatment,

             • Function renamed to ‘calc_MaxDose()’,

             • this is now just a wrapper function that calls the new
               ‘calc_MinDose()’ function, but transforms the data set
               similar to the method described in Olley et al. (2006).
               For further details please see the changes/bugfixes for
               the ‘calc_MinDose3()’ / ‘calc_MinDose4()’ functions,

             • plotting now done by ‘plot_RLum.Results()’.

         • ‘calc_MinDose3()’ and ‘calc_MinDose4()’

             • new argument ‘par’ that accepts a numeric value (either
               3 or 4) to set whether the 3- or 4-parametric Minimum
               Age Model should be applied,

             • new argument ‘bootstrap’ (logical) to apply the recycled
               bootstrap approach of Cunningham & Wallinga (2012),

               values for all parameters,

             • calculation and plotting of the maximum log likelihood
               functions/profiles are now done using the mle2()
               function of the 'bbmle' package

             • the optimisation routine was changed from 'nlminb' to
               'optim' using the 'L-BFGS-B' method,

             • confidence intervals for all parameters are now
               calculated by the 'confint()' method and exclusively on
               the 95% confidence level

             • the asymmetric error on gamma (i.e., the minimum dose)

               interval of the profile log likelihood function for
               gamma

             • a symmetric standard error for gamma is automatically
               derived from the 95% confidence interval of the profile
               log likelihood function by dividing the length of this
               interval by 3.92 (see Galbraith & Roberts, 2012).

             • new structure of the returned ‘RLum.Results’ object,

               'call', 'mle', 'BIC', 'confint', 'profile', 'bootstrap',

             • plotting now done by ‘plot_RLum.Results()’.

         • ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’:

             • Correct an error that causes ‘NA’ values within the
               curve errors for rare combinations of signal and
               background integreation limits,

             • provide a name for the output data frame ‘LxTx.table’
               for the ‘RLum.Results’ object,

             • error fixed for the marginal case that k = 2 and exceed
               the maximal curve length. In that case accidentially no
               error was calculated,

             • argument ‘sigmab’ was listed but was so far not
               implement. Fixed (#166)

         • ‘calc_TLLxTxRatio()’:

             • Lx/Tx ratio wrongly calculated as due to a coding error
               just the first value of the signal integral was taken
               for summing up the values and not the range of the
               values,

             • Output produced by the function now is a ‘list’ (data
               slot in the RLum object), to equal behavoir of the
               functions.

         • ‘fit_CWCurve()’:

             • Implement ‘...’ argument to replace explicit arguments
               ‘ylab’, ‘xlab’ and ‘main’,

             • Fix an issue that causes an error when input values were
               <= 0 (#123 reported by Johanna Lomax),

             • Correct wrong y-axis labelling (wrong channel resolution
               value).

         • ‘plot_AbanicoPlot()’:

             • numeric values allowed for parameter centrality,

             • KDE label value fixed,

             • layout functionality added,

             • error message for data with zero or without errors added
               (#154),

             • age models as input for lines supported (#107),

             • support of ‘par(mfcol())’l,

             • bug in lower z-axis limit eliminated,

             • example list updated (i.e. fast CAM instead of slow MAM)

             • bug for small values fixed, rounding to 0 decimals
               replaced by 3 significant digits,

             • parameter ‘at’ to allow user-defined z-tick positions,

               maximum extend of the data set,

             • argument ‘given.dose’ now allows a vector as input,
               e.g., if more then one data set is provided (#156),

             • argument ‘given.dose’ are not required any longer
               (became an optional argument).  With this the plot
               function can be easily re-used, e.g. for preheat plateau
               tests,

             • change behaviour of the argument ‘na.rm’. If a data set
               is provided containing ‘NA’ values also the
               corresponding values in provided by the argument
               ‘preheat’ are cleaned up. This allows a proper usage of
               the function in combination with grouping option (e.g.,
               ‘boxplot = TRUE’,

             • add argument ‘par.local’ to allow to combine output
               plots in broader plot frameworks,

               'Frequency',

             • support of ‘par(mfcol())’ (#146),

             • support of data without and ‘NA’-values for error values

               exists (#160),

             • De.stats error fixed (#163),

             • support of ‘par(mfcol())’,

             • support of error-free data extended (now also for
               calculation of kde max) (#178),

             • individual statistical summary order supported (#184).

             • Minor graphical and code polishing,

             • fix wrong regneration point plotting, if sequence
               contains more then one zero dose point,

             • argument ‘na.exclude’ for the sake consistency replaced
               by ‘na.rm’,

             • proper error message provided if nothing is left after
               ‘NA’ value removal,

             • overshoot of normal distribution curve in MC simulation
               plot corrected (#111),

             • argument ‘output.plotExtended.single’ added allowing a
               single window plot output of all plots,

             • formula of the fitted function is now returend as R
               expression instead of a ‘formula’ object. The return
               object remains, however, ‘Formula’,

             • correct wrong error message and graphical output for
               cases where no De can be calculated for Ln/Tn values
               much higher than the highest Lx/Tx value,

             • fix ‘'EXP+EXP'’ fit as is was broken, due to a coding

             • minor fixes for the graphical output.

         • ‘plot_RLum.Analysis()’:

             • Add argument ‘abline’ to allow inserting similar
               vertical or horizontal lines in every plot. The decision
               to implement this argument in this function instead the
               function ‘plot_RLum.Data.Curve()’ was made because in a
               single plot modus ‘abline’ is more sufficiently used as
               separat function call,

             • now reset ‘par’ parameters suffciently,

             • add argument ‘combine’ to allow fast combining of curves

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()’:

             • Correct an error that caused a chrash when ‘xlim’ was
               set in a way that only one wavelength (colour value) was
               remained,

             • correct zebra-colour-pattern for rare cases of ‘xlim’
               settings using ‘plot.type = "persp"’ or ‘plot.type =
               "persp3d"’,

             • add argument new plot type ‘"transect"’ for plotting a
               transect along the time/temperature axis for a specific
               wavelength/channel intervall (#120, requested by Regina
               DeWitt),

             • correct function break for a single column matrix
               (single frame spectrum) by automatically resetting
               ‘plot.type’ to ‘single’ for single frame spectra,

             • colour rug (‘rug = TRUE’) implemented for plot type
               ‘"multiple.lines"’ (#130),

             • argument ‘xaxis.energy’ for wavelength energy conversion
               for 2D plots added (#141).

         • ‘readBIN2R()’:

             • Integrity checks added to avoid unspecific errors for
               wrong input formats,

             • complete format support as now a more throughtful
               distinction is made between version 03 and 04 (also made
               for function ‘writeR2BIN()’) (#182),

             • ‘TAG’ bit is now used to trigger the ‘SEL’ element
               during import.  With this, previous curve selections
               made with other software are kept (#181, Norbert
               Mercier).

         • ‘readXSYG2R()’:

             • If the stimulator is infrared light the ‘recordType’
               will be set to ‘IRSL’. This makes the curve types more
               consistent with the commonly applied nomenclature,

             • now the function automatically converts time values to
               temperature values also for spectra data (#121);
               behavious is triggered with the argument
               ‘recalculate.TL.curves’.

         • ‘Second2Gray()’:

             • Minor code and example adjustments in along with
               creating a new function ‘calc_SourceDoseRate()’ (#56).

         • ‘writeBIN2R()’:

             • Complete format support as now a more throughtful
               distinction is made between version 03 and 04 (also made
               for function ‘readBIN2R()’) (#182),

             • ‘SEL’ will now be kept using the ‘TAG’ bit, releated to
               changes made in function ‘readBIN2R’ (#181, Norbert
               Mercier).

  Internals:

         • Add new dependency for package ‘raster’ and ‘sp’, which is
           used for the ‘RLum.Data.Image-class’,

         • dependency to package 'Rserve' removed,

         • dependcy to package 'zoo' added (used for running means),

         • dependency to package 'bbmle' added (used for maximum
           likelihood estimations).
