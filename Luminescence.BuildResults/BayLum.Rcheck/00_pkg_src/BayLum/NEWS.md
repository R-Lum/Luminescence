# BayLum 0.3.1 (2023-03-28)

**This version of `'BayLum'` requires R\>=4.1.x!**

## Bugfixes and changes

- `AgeS_Computation()` & `Age_OSLC14()` had two instances of the
  MCMC-list. One has been removed. This essentially halves the amount of
  memory needed to store the output of these functions. (Thanks to G.
  Gu√©rin for reporting) (#27)

- `AgeS_Computation()` crashed reproducibly, if the THETA matrix (as one
  possibility) was provided indeed as a file name instead of a `matrix`
  object; fixed (thanks to M. Heydari for reporting)

- `AgeS_Computation()` the function handles wrong user input for the
  Theta matrix more friendly by converting it automatically to a matrix
  if needed.

- `create_ThetaMatrix()` the function did not throw an error in all
  cases where `sigma_s` was obviously wrong; fixed (thanks to M. Heydari
  for reporting)

- `Generate_DataFile_MG()` the function now checks that the number of
  specified BIN/BINX-files matches the actual number of BIN/BINX-files
  present in the folders. If not, a warning is prompted. This prevents
  hard-to-track-down error messages and odd modelling results that
  erroneously encourage searching for problems with JAGS or the
  `'BayLum'` models.

- `plot_Ages()` gained a couple of new arguments. First, `plot_mode`
  allows to switch between the standard plot output `"ages"` (the
  default) and the new option `"density"`. The latter draws probability
  density curves instead of lines. Further arguments specific to the
  `plot_mode = "density"` are `d_scale` to scale the density plots in
  height and `show_ages` to show the Bayes estimator. More generally,
  `legend.cex` was added to enable a convenient scaling of the legend
  fonts; this works for both plot modes.

- `plot_MCMC()` gained additional support for `BayLum.list` returned by
  `Age_OSLC14()`

- `plot_Scatterplots()` The functions can now handle `BayLum.list`
  objects if returned by certain functions. Currently:
  `AgesS_Computation()`, `Age_OSLC14()`
