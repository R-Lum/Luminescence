# Introduction

`'BayLum'` provides a collection of various **R** functions for Bayesian analysis of luminescence data. 
Amongst others, this includes data import, export, application of age models and palaeodose modelling.

Data can be processed simultaneously for various samples, including the input of multiple BIN/BINX-files per
sample for single grain (SG) or multi-grain (MG) OSL measurements. Stratigraphic constraints and 
systematic errors can be added to constrain the analysis further.

For those who already know how to use **R**, `'BayLum'` won't be difficult to use, 
for all others, this brief introduction may be of help to make the first steps with **R** and 
the package `'BayLum'` as convenient as possible. 

## Installing `BayLum' package

If you read this document before having installed **R** itself, you should first visit the 
[R project](https://www.r-project.org) website and download and install **R**. 
You may also consider installing [Rstudio]( https://posit.co), 
which provides an excellent desktop working environment for **R**; however it is not 
a prerequisite.

You will also need the external software *JAGS* (Just Another Gibs Sampler). 
Please visit the [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io) webpage and follow the installation instructions. 
Now you are nearly ready to work with 'BayLum'. 

If you have not yet installed `BayLum', please run the following two **R** code lines to 
install 'BayLum' on your computer.

```{r,eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
if(!require("BayLum"))
  install.packages("BayLum", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, you can load an already installed **R** package (here 'BayLum') into your session by using 
the following **R** call.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(BayLum)
```

# First steps: age analysis of one sample

## Import information from a BIN/BINX-file.

Let us consider the sample named *samp1*, which is the example dataset coming with the package. 
All information related to this sample is stored in a subfolder called also *samp1*.
To test the package example, first, we add the path of the example
dataset to the object `path`.

```{r}
path <- paste0(system.file("extdata/", package = "BayLum"), "/")
```

Please note that for your own dataset (i.e. not included in the package)
you have to replace this call by something like:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
path <- "Users/Master_of_luminescence/Documents/MyFamousOSLData"
```

In our example the folder contains the following subfolders and files:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(list.files(path, recursive = TRUE),
             col.names = "",
             row.names = TRUE)
```

See *"What are the required files in each subfolder?"* in the manual of  `Generate_DataFile()` function
for the meaning of these files.

To import your data, simply call the function `Generate_DataFile()`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
DATA1 <-
  Generate_DataFile(
  Path = path,
  FolderNames = "samp1",
  Nb_sample = 1,
  verbose = FALSE)
```

### Remarks

#### Data import/export

The import may take a while, in particular for large BIN/BINX-files. This can become annoying if you want to play with the data. 
In such situations, it makes sense to save your imported data somewhere else before continuing. 

To save the obove imported data on your hardrive use

```{r,eval=FALSE}
save(DATA1, file = "YourPath/DATA1.RData")
```

To load the data use

```{r,eval=FALSE}
load(DATA1, file = "YourPath/DATA1.RData")
```

#### Data structure

To see the overall structure of the data generated from the BIN/BINX-file and the associated CSV-files,
the following call can be used:

```{r}
str(DATA1)
```

It reveals that `DATA1` is basically a list with `r length(DATA1)` elements:

Element                | Content |
---------------------- |---------------
`DATA1$LT`             | Lx/Tx values from each sample |
`DATA1$sLT`            | Lx/Tx error values from each sample |
`DATA1$ITimes`         | Irradiation times |
`DATA1$dLab`           | The lab dose rate |
`DATA1$ddot_env`       | The environmental dose rate and its variance |
`DATA1$regDose`        | The regenarated dose points |
`DATA1$J`              | The number of aliquots selected for each BIN-file |
`DATA1$K`              | The number of regenarted dose points |
`DATA1$Nb_measurement` | The number of measurements per BIN-file |

#### Visualise Lx/Tx values and dose points

To get an impression on how your data look like, you can visualise them by 
using the function `LT_RegenDose()`:

```{r, fig.align='center'}
LT_RegenDose(
  DATA = DATA1,
  Path = path,
  FolderNames = "samp1",
  SampleNames = "samp1",
  Nb_sample = 1,
  nrow = NULL
  )
```

Note that here we consider only one sample, and the name of the folder is the name of the sample.
For that reason the argumetns were set to `FolderNames = samp1` and `SampleNames = samp1`.

## Generate data file from BIN/BINX-files of multi-grain OSL measurements

For a multi-grain OSL measurements, instead of `Generate_DataFile()`, the function `Generate_DataFile_MG()` should
be used with similar parameters. The functions differ by their expectations: *Disc.csv* instead of *DiscPos.csv* file for Single-grain OSL Measurements.
Please check type `?Generate_DataFile_MG` for further information.

## Age computation 

To compute the age of the sample *samp1*, you can run the following code:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
Age <- Age_Computation(
  DATA = DATA1,
  SampleName = "samp1",
  PriorAge = c(10, 100),
  distribution = "cauchy",
  LIN_fit = TRUE,
  Origin_fit = FALSE,
  Iter = 10000
  )
```

This also works if `DATA1` is the output of `Generate_DataFile_MG()`.

##### Remark 1: MCMC trajectories

- If MCMC trajectories did not converge, you can add more iteration with the parameter `Iter` in the function `Age_Computation()`,
for example `Iter = 20000` or `Iter = 50000`. If it is not desirable to re-run the model from scratch, read the 

- To increase the precision of prior distribution, if not specified before you can use the argument `PriorAge`. 
For example: `PriorAge= c(0.01,10)` for a young sample and `PriorAge = c(10,100)` for an old sample.

- If the trajectories are still not convergering, you should whether the choice you made with the argument `distribution` and 
dose-response curves are meaningful.

##### Remark 2: `LIN_fit` and `Origin_fit`, dose-response curves option

- By default, a saturating exponential plus linear dose response curve is expected. However, you choose other formula by changing arguments
`LIN_fit` and `Origin_fit` in the function.

##### Remark 3: `distribution`, equivalent dose dispersion option

By default, a *cauchy* distribution is assumed, but you can choose another distribution by replacing the
word `cauchy` by `gaussian`, `lognormal_A` or `lognormal_M` for the argument `distribution`.

The difference between the models: *lognormal_A* and *lognormal_M* is that the equivalent dose dispersion
are distributed according to:

- a log-normal distribution with mean or average equal to the palaeodose for the first model
- a log-normal distribution with median equal to the palaeodose for the second model.


##### Remark 4: `SavePdf` and `SaveEstimates` option

These two arguments allow to save the results to files.

- `SavePdf = TRUE` create a PDF-file with MCMC trajectories of parameters `A` (age), `D` (palaeodose), `sD` (equivalent doses dispersion).
You have to specify `OutputFileName` and `OutputFilePath` to define name and path of the PDF-file.

- `SaveEstimates = TRUE` saves a CSV-file containing the Bayes estimates, the credible interval at 68\% and 95\%  and the Gelman and Rudin test of
convergence of the parameters `A`, `D`, `sD`. For the export the arguments `OutputTableName` and `OutputTablePath` have to be specified.

##### Remark 4: `PriorAge` option

By default, an age between 0.01 ka and 100 ka is expected.
If the user has more informations on the sample, `PriorAge` should be modified accordingly.

For example, if you know that the sample is an older, you can set `PriorAge=c(10,120)`. In contrast, if you know that the sample is younger,
you may want to set `PriorAge=c(0.001,10)`. Ages of $<=0$ are not possible. The minimum bound is 0.001.

**Please note that the setting of `PriorAge` is not trivial, wrongly set boundaries are likely biasing
your results.**

## Multiple BIN/BINX-files for one sample

In the previous example we considered only the simplest case: one sample, and one BIN/BINX-file.
However, 'BayLum' allows to process multiple BIN/BINX-files for one sample.
To work with multiple BIN/BINX-files, the names of the subfolders need to beset in argument `Names` and
both files need to be located unter the same `Path`.

For the case

```{r}
Names <- c("samp1", "samp2")
```

the call `Generate_DataFile()` (or `Generate_DataFile_MG()`) becomes as follows:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
##argument setting
nbsample <- 1
nbbinfile <- length(Names)
Binpersample <- c(length(Names))

##call data file generator
DATA_BF <- Generate_DataFile(
  Path = path,
  FolderNames = Names,
  Nb_sample = nbsample,
  Nb_binfile = nbbinfile,
  BinPerSample = Binpersample,
  verbose = FALSE
  )

##calculate the age
Age <- Age_Computation(
  DATA = DATA_BF,
  SampleName = Names,
  BinPerSample = Binpersample
  )
```

# Age analysis of various samples

## Generate data file from BIN/BINX-files

The function `Generate_DataFile()`  (or `Generate_DataFile_MF()`) can process multiple files
simultaneously including multiple BIN/BINX-files per sample. 

We assume that we are interested in two samples named: *sample1* and *sample2*. In addition, we have 
two BIN/BINX-files for the first sample named: *sample1-1* and *sample1-2*, and one BIN-file for the 2nd sample named *sample2-1*.
In such case, we need three subfolders named *sample1-1*, *sample1-2* and *sample2-1*;
which each subfolder containing only one BIN-file named **bin.BIN**, and its associated files **DiscPos.csv**, **DoseEnv.csv**, **DoseSourve.csv** and **rule.csv**.
All of these 3 subfolders must be located in *path*.

To fill the argument corectly `BinPerSample`: $binpersample=c(\underbrace{2}_{\text{sample 1: 2 bin files}},\underbrace{1}_{\text{sample 2: 1 bin file}})$

```{r,eval=FALSE}
Names <-
  c("sample1-1", "sample1-2", "sample2-1") # give the name of the folder datat
  nbsample <- 2    # give the number of samples
  nbbinfile <- 3   # give the number of bin files
  DATA <- Generate_DataFile(
  Path = path,
  FolderNames = Names,
  Nb_sample = nbsample,
  Nb_binfile = nbbinfile,
  BinPerSample = binpersample
  )
```

### Combine files using the function `combine_DataFiles()`

If the user has already saved informations imported with `Generate_DataFile()` function  (or `Generate_DataFile_MG()` function) 
these data can be concatenate with the function `combine_DataFiles()`.

For example, if `DATA1` is the output of sample named "GDB3", and `DATA2` is the output of sample "GDB5",
both data can be merged with the following call:

```{r}
data("DATA1", envir = environment())
data("DATA2", envir = environment())
DATA3 <- combine_DataFiles(L1 = DATA2, L2 = DATA1)
str(DATA3)
```

The data structure should become as follows

- 2 `list`s (1 `list` per sample) for `DATA$LT`, `DATA$sLT`, `DATA1$ITimes` and `DATA1$regDose`
- A `matrix` with 2 columns (1 line per sample) for `DATA1$dLab`, `DATA1$ddot_env`
- 2 `integer`s (1 `integer` per BIN files here we have 1 BIN-file per sample) for `DATA1$J`, `DATA1$K`, `DATA1$Nb_measurement`.

Single-grain and multiple-grain OSL measurements can be merged in the same way.
To plot the $L/T$ as a function of the regenerative dose the function `LT_RegenDose()` can be
used again:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
LT_RegenDose(
  DATA = DATA3,
  Path = path,
  FolderNames = Names,
  Nb_sample = nbsample,
  SG = rep(TRUE, nbsample)
)
```

*Note: In the example `DATA3` contains information from the samples 'GDB3' and 'GDB5', which are single-grain OSL measurements. For a correct treatment the argument `SG` has to be manually set by the user. Please see the function manual for further details.*

## Age analysis without stratigraphic constraints

If no stratigraphic constraints were set, the following code can be used to analyse the age of the sample *GDB5* and *GDB3* simultaneously.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
priorage = c(1, 10, 10, 100)
Age <- AgeS_Computation(
  DATA = DATA3,
  Nb_sample = 2,
  SampleNames = c("GDB5", "GDB3"),
  PriorAge = priorage,
  distribution = "cauchy",
  LIN_fit = TRUE,
  Origin_fit = FALSE,
  Iter = 1000, 
  jags_method = "rjags"
)
```

**Note:** For an automated parallel processing you can set the argument `jags_method = "rjags"` to 
 `jags_method = "rjparallel"`.

### Remarks
As for the function `Age_computation()`, the age for each sample is set by default between 0.01 ka and 100 ka.
If you have more informations on your samples it is possible to change `PriorAge` parameters.
`PriorAge` is a vector of `size = 2*$Nb_sample`, the two first values of `PriorAge`
concern the 1st sample, the next two values the 2nd sample  and so on.

For example, if you know that sample named *GDB5* is a young sample whose its age is between 0.01 ka and 10 ka,
and *GDB3* is an old sample whose age is between 10 ka and 100 ka,
$$PriorAge=c(\underbrace{0.01,10}_{GDB5\ prior\ age},\underbrace{10,100}_{GDB3\ prior\ age})$$

## Age analysis with stratigraphic constraints

With the function `AgeS_Computation()` it is possible to take the stratigraphic
relations between samples into account and define constraints.

For example, we know that *GDB5* is in a higher stratigraphical position, hence it likely has 
a younger age than sample *GDB3*.

### Ordering samples

To take into account stratigraphic constraints, the information on the samples need to be ordered.
Either you enter a sample name (corresponding to subfolder names) in `Names` parameter of the function `Generate_DataFile()`, ordered by order of increasing ages or you enter saved .RData informations of each sample in `combine_DataFiles()`, ordered by increasing ages.

```{r}
# using Generate_DataFile function
Names <- c("samp1", "samp2")
nbsample <- 2
DATA3 <- Generate_DataFile(
  Path = path,
  FolderNames = Names,
  Nb_sample = nbsample,
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

```{r}
# using the function combine_DataFiles()
data(DATA1, envir = environment()) # .RData on sample GDB3
data(DATA2, envir = environment()) # .RData on sample GDB5
DATA3 <- combine_DataFiles(L1 = DATA1, L2 = DATA2)
```

### Define matrix to set stratigraphic constraints

Let `SC` be the matrix containing all information on stratigraphic relations for this two samples.
This matrix is defined as follows:

- matrix dimensions: the row number of `StratiConstraints` matrix is equal to `Nb_sample+1`,
and column number is equal to $Nb\_sample$.

- first matrix row: for all $i$ in $\{1,...,Nb\_Sample\}$, `StratiConstraints[1,i] <- 1`,
means that the lower bound of the sample age given in `PriorAge[2i-1]` for the sample whose number ID
is equal to $i$ is taken into account

- sample relations: for all $j$ in $\{2,...,Nb\_Sample+1}\$ and all $i$ in $\{j,...,Nb\_Sample\}$,
`StratiConstraints[j,i] <- 1` if the sample age whose ID is equal to $j-1$ is lower than the sample age whose ID is equal to $i$.
Otherwise, `StratiConstraints[j,i] <- 0`.

To the define such matrix the function *SCMatrix()* can be used:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SC <- SCMatrix(Nb_sample = 2,
               SampleNames = c("samp1", "samp2"))
```

In our case: 2 samples, `SC` is a matrix with 3 rows and 2 columns. The first row contains `c(1,1)` (because we take into account the prior ages), the second line contains `c(0,1)` (sample 2, named *samp2* is supposed to be older than sample 1, named *samp1*) and the third line contains `c(0,0)` (sample 2, named *samp2* is not younger than the sample 1, here named *samp1*). We can also fill the matrix with the stratigraphic relations as follow:

```{r}
SC <- matrix(
  data = c(1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),
  ncol = 2,
  nrow = (2 + 1),
  byrow = T
  )
```

### Age computation

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
Age <-
  AgeS_Computation(
  DATA = DATA3,
  Nb_sample = 2,
  SampleNames = c("samp1", "samp2"),
  PriorAge = priorage,
  distribution = "cauchy",
  LIN_fit = TRUE,
  Origin_fit = FALSE,
  StratiConstraints = SC,
  Iter = 1000, 
  jags_method = 'rjags')
```

Thee results can be also be used for an alternative graphical representation: 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
plot_Ages(Age, plot_mode = "density")
```
## When MCMC trajectories did not converge
If MCMC trajectories did not converge, it means we should run additional MCMC iterations.  
For `AgeS_computation()` and `Age_OSLC14()` models we can run additional iterations by supplying the function output back into the parent function.
In the following, notice we are using the output of the previous `AgeS_computation()` example, namely `Age`. The key argument to set/change is `DATA`.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
Age <- AgeS_Computation(
  DATA = Age,
  Nb_sample = 2,
  SampleNames = c("GDB5", "GDB3"),
  PriorAge = priorage,
  distribution = "cauchy",
  LIN_fit = TRUE,
  Origin_fit = FALSE,
  Iter = 1000, 
  jags_method = "rjags"
)
```
