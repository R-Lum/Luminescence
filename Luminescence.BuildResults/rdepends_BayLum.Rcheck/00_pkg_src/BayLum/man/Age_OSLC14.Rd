If there is stratigraphic relations between samples, informations in DATA must be ordered by order of
increasing ages. See the details section to for more informations.
(2): an object of class \code{BayLum.list} which is provided by the output of \link{Age_OSLC14}. When input of class \code{BayLum.list} is identified, no new JAGS model is created. Instead, the JAGS model specified within the \code{BayLum.list} is extended. Useful for when convergence was not originally achieved and a complete restart is not desirable.}

\item{Data_C14Cal}{\link{numeric} vector: corresponding to C-14 age estimate
(in years, conversion in ka is automatically done in the function).

\enumerate{
\item \bold{A list containing the following objects:}
\itemize{
\item \bold{Sampling}: that corresponds to a sample of the posterior distributions of the age parameters (in ka for both C14 samples and OSL samples);
\item \bold{PriorAge}: stating the priors used for the age parameter;
\item \bold{StratiConstraints}: stating the stratigraphic relations between samples considered in the model;
\item \bold{Model_OSL_GrowthCurve}: stating which dose response fitting option was chosen;
\item \bold{Model_OSL_Distribution}: stating which distribution was chosen to model the dispersion of
individual equivalent dose values around the palaeodose of the sample;
\item \bold{Model_C14}: stating which model was chosen (\code{"full"} or \code{"naive"});

}

\item \bold{The Gelman and Rubin test of convergency}: prints the result of the Gelman and Rubin test of convergence for the age estimate for each sample.
A result close to one is expected.\cr
In addition, the user must visually assess the convergence of the trajectories by looking at the graph
generated by the function (see \bold{PLOT OUTPUT} for more informations).\cr
If both convergences (Gelman and Rubin test and plot checking) are satisfactory,
the user can consider the estimates as valid.
Otherwise, the user may try increasing the number of MCMC iterations (\code{Iter})
or be more precise on the \code{PriorAge} parameter to reach convergence.
\item \bold{Credible intervals and Bayes estimates}: prints the Bayes' estimates, the credible intervals at 95\% and 68\% for
the age parameters for each sample.
\item \bold{JAGS model output}: returns the JAGS model with class "runjags".
}

\bold{PLOT OUTPUT}

\enumerate{
\item\bold{MCMC trajectories}: A graph with the MCMC trajectories and posterior distributions of the age parameter is displayed. \cr
On each line, the plot on the left represents the MCMC trajectories, and the one on the right the posterior distribution of the parameter.
\item \bold{Age estimate and HPD at 95\% of 14C samples on calibration curve}: plot age estimate and HPD on calibration plot.
\item \bold{Summary of sample age estimates}: plot credible intervals and Bayes estimate of each sample age on a same graph.

}
\description{
This function computes an age of OSL data consisting of at least two samples and calibrate
C-14 ages of samples to get an age (in ka).\cr
Ages of OSL data are computed according to the model given in Combes and Philippe (2017).
Single-grain or Multi-grain OSL measurements can be analysed simultaneously
(with output of \link{Generate_DataFile} or \link{Generate_DataFile_MG} or both of them using \link{combine_DataFiles}).
Samples, for which data is available in several BIN files, can be analysed.\cr
For C-14 data, the user can choose one of the following radiocarbon calibration curve:
Northern or Southern Hemisphere or marine atmospheric.

\strong{How to fill `StratiConstraints?}\cr

If there are stratigraphic relations between samples, \bold{14C estimate age in \code{Data_C14Cal} must be ordered by order of increasing ages,
as informations in \code{DATA}}. Names in \code{SampleNames} must be ordered and corresponds to the order in \code{Data_C14Cal} and in \code{DATA},
also if it is needed to mix names of OSL samples and 14C samples.

The user can fill the \code{StratiConstraints} matrix as follow.
\enumerate{
\item \bold{Size of the matrix}: row number of \code{StratiConstraints} matrix is equal to \code{Nb_sample+1},
and column number is equal to \code{Nb_sample}.
\item \bold{First line of the matrix}:
for all \code{i in {1,...,Nb_Sample}}, \code{StratiConstraints[1,i]=1} that means the lower bound of the sample age (given in \code{PriorAge[2i-1]})
for the sample whose number ID is equal to \code{i}, is taken into account.
\item \bold{Sample relations}: for all  \code{j in {2,...,Nb_Sample+1}} and all \code{i in {j,...,Nb_Sample}},
\code{StratiConstraints[j,i]=1} if sample age whose number ID is equal to \code{j-1} is lower than sample age whose number ID is equal to \code{i}.
Otherwise, \code{StratiConstraints[j,i]=0}.
}
Note that \code{StratiConstraints_{2:Nb_sample+1,1:Nb_sample}} is a upper triangular matrix.

The user can also use \code{\link{SCMatrix}}  or \code{\link{SC_Ordered}} (if all samples are ordered) function to construct
the \code{StratiConstraints} matrix.

The user can also refer to a csv file that contains the relation between samples as defined above.
The user must be careful about which separator is used in the csv file using the argument \code{sepSC}.\cr

\strong{How to fill \code{THETA} covariance matrix concerning common and individual error?}\cr

If systematic errors are considered, the user can fill the \code{THETA} matrix as follow.
\itemize{
\item row number of \code{THETA} is equal the column number, equal to \code{Nb_sample}.
\item For all \code{i in {1,...,Nb_sample}}, \code{THETA[i,i]} contains individual error
plus systematic error of the sample whose number ID is equal to \code{i}.
\item For all \code{i,j in {1,...,Nb_sample}} and \code{i} different from \code{j} ,
\code{THETA[i,j]} contains common error between samples whose number ID are equal to \code{i} and \code{j}.
}
Note that \code{THETA[i,j]} is a symmetric matrix.

The user can also refer to a .csv file that contains the errors as defined above.\cr

\strong{Option on growth curves}\cr

As for \code{\link{Age_Computation}} and \code{\link{Palaeodose_Computation}}, the user can choose from 4 dose response curves:
\itemize{
\item \bold{Saturating exponential plus linear growth} (\code{AgesMultiCS2_EXPLIN}):

for all \code{x} in IR+, \code{f(x)=a(1-exp(-x/b))+cx+d}; select
\itemize{
\item \code{LIN_fit=TRUE}
\item \code{Origin_fit=FALSE}
}
\item \bold{Saturating exponential growth} (\code{AgesMultiCS2_EXP}):

for all \code{x} in IR+, \code{f(x)=a(1-exp(-x/b))+d}; select
\itemize{
\item \code{LIN_fit=FALSE}
\item \code{Origin_fit=FALSE}
}
\item \bold{Saturating exponential plus linear growth and fitting through the origin} (\code{AgesMultiCS2_EXPLINZO}):

for all \code{x} in IR+, \code{f(x)=a(1-exp(-x/b))+cx}; select
\itemize{
\item \code{LIN_fit=TRUE}
\item \code{Origin_fit=TRUE}
}
\item \bold{Saturating exponential growth and fitting through the origin} (\code{AgesMultiCS2_EXPZO}):

for all \code{x} in IR+, \code{f(x)=a(1-exp(-x/b))}; select
\itemize{
\item \code{LIN_fit=FALSE}
\item \code{Origin_fit=TRUE}
}
}

\strong{Option on equivalent dose distribution around the palaeodose}\cr

The use can choose between :
\itemize{
\item \code{cauchy}: a Cauchy distribution with location parameter equal to the palaeodose of the sample
\item \code{gaussian}: a Gaussian distribution with mean equal to the palaeodose of the sample
\item \code{lognormal_A}: a log-normal distribution with mean or \bold{A}verage equal to the palaeodose of the sample
\item \code{lognormal_M}: a log-normal distribution with \bold{M}edian equal to the palaeodose of the sample
}

\strong{More precision on \code{Model}}\cr

We propose two models "full" or "naive". If \code{Model='full'} that means measurement error and error on calibration curve are taken account in
the Bayesian model; if \code{Model="naive"} that means only error on measurement are taken account in the mode.

More precisely, the model considered here, as the one developed by Christen, JA (1994), assume multiplicative effect of errors to address the
problem of outliers. In addition, to not penalise variables that are not outliers and damage theirs estimation,
we introduce a structure of mixture, that means only variable that are considered as outlier have in addition a multiplicative error.
}
\note{
Please note that the initial values for all MCMC are currently all the same for all chains since we rely on the automatic
initial value generation of JAGS. This is not optimal and will be changed in future. However, it does not affect the quality
of the age estimates if the chains have converged.
