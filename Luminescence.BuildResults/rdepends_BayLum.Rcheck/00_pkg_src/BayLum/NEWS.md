## BayLum 0.2.0 (2020-12-06)

*Note: This package version needs at least R &gt;= 3.5.0.*

### Bugfixes & changes

-   `AgeS_Computation()`
    -   Now stops if a mismatch was encountered between the number of
        samples and the matrix provided via `THETA` to prevent a ‘JAGS’
        runtime error
    -   The function experimentally gained a new argument `jags_method`
        to support full automated processing in parallel using the R
        package `'runjags'`; including a `...` argument for a more
        detailed control. By default the calculation is done simply via
        `'rjags'` as usual
-   `Age_OSLC14()`
    -   Add additional output to enhance output table by additional
        information (\#11)
    -   The CSV-file option now returns the age and the HPD intervals
    -   The bugs model for the `gaussian` distribution did not work due
        to a wrongly set index (\#13); fixed.
    -   If a small number of samples was used and the first was a C-14
        sample JAGS crashed; now it throws are more comprehensible error
        message (\#14).
-   `Generate_DataFile_MG()`
    -   now works only on preselected records; the limitation of OSL
        only was removed.
-   `plot_Ages()`
    -   The sorting of the samples in the graph did not work as
        expected; along with this a new argument `sample_order` was
        added.
    -   The function accepts a data.frame as alternative input, if the
        `data.frame` is similar the data frames created by the
        computation functions (e.g., `AgeS_Computation()`). This option
        enables the manual creation of age plots from self-compiled
        data.
-   `plot_MCMC()`
    -   Accidentally the function could not display the chains from more
        than 9 samples; fixed (thanks to Maryam Heydari)
    -   Now the function understand the output of `AgeS_Computation()`
        for an automated treatment
    -   Wrong variable names now lead to a `warning` instead of a
        `stop`. This is less aggressive and it makes the function easier
        to use by users who only use the plot functionality of
        `'BayLum'`
-   `plot_Scatterplots()`
    -   Line breaks and leading and trailing white space is now removed
        from the character (vector) provided via `sample_names`
    -   If the number of selected samples via `sample_selection` was
        shorter than the number of names provided by `sample_names` the
        function returned an `subscript out of bounds` error; fixed
        (reported by Maryam Heydari)

#### Internals

-   All models now come with an example showing how they can be
    inspected (before the examples not working)
-   Fix a couple of documentation glitches (e.g., part of the
    documentation was missing)
-   Smooth the creation of `BayLum.list` objects using a central
    internal function
-   Add new C-14 calibration data and unify the names of those datasets.
    Allowed inputs are
    `"IntCal13"`,`"IntCal20"`,`"Marine13"`,`"Marine20"`, `"SHCal13"`,
    `"SHCal20"` or an own dataset which must be stored in a CSV-file.

### New functions

-   `create_ThetaMatrix()` this function is a helper to create the theta
    matrix that can be provided as input for the functions
    `AgeS_Computation()` and `Age_OSLC14()`
-   `create_FolderTemplates()` creates the folder and file structures
    required by `Generate_DataFile()` and `Generate_DataFile_MG()` on
    the user’s hard drive

## BayLum 0.1.3 (Release date: 2018-09-14)

### New functions

-   `plot_Ages()` this function replaces code used internally by the
    functions `AgeC14_Compution()` and `AgeS_Computation()` to create an
    age overview plot. Before the user had no control over the
    appearance of age plot output. This is still the case if the
    functions `AgeC14_Compution()`, `AgeS_Computation()` and
    `Age_OSLC14()` are used (although internally only the function
    `plot_Ages()` is called), however, both functions now return a new
    list of class `BayLum.list` which is recognised by the function
    `plot_Ages()` and can be used to plot the typical age plot while
    providing several arguments for adjusting the plot output.

### Bugfixes & changes

-   The newly introduced function `combine_DataFiles()` did not work on
    R &lt; 3.5.0, which caused an error on CRAN; fixed.
-   The function `ScatterSamples()` is replaced by the function
    `plot_Scatterplots()`
-   All computation functions left text connections open after they have
    been exited; fixed.
-   The output of `AgeC14_Compution()` and `AgeS_Computation()` gain a
    new class `BayLum.list`
-   Redundant code in `AgeC14_Compution()` and `AgeS_Computation()` has
    been removed
-   The argument `Nb_chaines` was replaced by `n.chains` wherever it
    occurred in the package (functions and documentation)
-   The function `plot_Scatterplots()` gained a new argument
    `plot_type`, allowing to switch between the default hexbin plot and
    a function developed for ’BayLum`(`plot\_type = “smoothScatter”\`)
-   The function `plot_Scatterplots()` gained a new argument `plot_mode`
    to allow single xy plots
-   The function `plot_Scatterplots()` now accepts a two column
    `data.frame` as inputbuild

### Internals

-   Add new package dependency `KernSmooth` used in
    `plot_Scatterplots()`

## BayLum 0.1.2 (Release date: 2018-06-22)

### New functions

-   The function `MCMC_plot()` was replaced by the newly written
    function `plot_MCMC()`
-   The function `Concat_DataFile()` is deprecated and is basically
    replaced by the function `combine_DataFiles()`

### Bugfixes

-   The functions `AgeC14_Compution()` and `Age_OSL14()` now returns age
    results with two digits
-   The function `AgeS_Computation()` now returns the MCMC information
    from all samples of the PDF output is set to `TRUE`
-   The function `Age_OSLC14()` never returned numerical data; fixed
-   Fix `Age_OSLC14()` age format, now in ka for C-14 instead of years
-   The last example in `AgeS_Computation()` could not be run; fixed
-   C-14 calibration datasets now show data in ‘ka’ and not ‘a’
-   Various typo corrections.

### Enhancements

-   Allow different BIN/BINX-file names as input. The functions
    `Generate_DataFile()` and `Generate_DataFile_MG()` do no longer
    expecting the name sheme bin.BIN
-   The functions `Generate_DataFile()` and `Generate_DataFile_MG()` now
    supports the `...` argument to pass further arguments to the
    function `Luminescene::read_BIN2R()`
-   The functions `Generate_DataFile()` and `Generate_DataFile_MG()`
    gained a new argument `verbose` to control the terminal output
-   The function
    `Age_Computation()`,`AgeS_Computation()`,`AgeC14_Computation()`,
    `Age_OSLC14()` now support the argument `quiet` and pipe it to
    `rjags` to suppress the terminal output
-   The function `AgeC14_Computation()` now returns a warning if
    outliers are detected.
-   The function `LT_RegenDose()` gained two new arguments `nrow` and
    `ncol` became a little bit more user friendly

### Internals

-   Set patch level to 0 (for 3.3.0) to account for CRAN note
-   Vignette was updated and corrected

## BayLum 0.1.1 (Release date: 2017-09-01)

-   Reduce required R version to 3.3.2

## BayLum 0.1.0 (Release date: 2017-08-22)
