RLumShiny 0.2.2 (Release date: 2019-01-11)
==============

* PREVIEW: New application that scales the gamma dose rate considering layer-to-layer
  variations in soil radioactivity. Base function: `Luminescence::scale_GammaDose()`.
  Keyword for `app_RLum()`: 'scalegamma'.
  
  NOTE: This application will only start if the development version 0.9.x of the
  R package `Luminescence` is installed as the function `scale_GammaDose()` is
  still under development.

* New application to support the new R package `RCarb`. Base function `RCarb::model_DoseRate()`.
  Keyword for `app_RLum()`: 'RCarb'

* Removed and updated deprecated links from the "About"-tab in all applications.



RLumShiny 0.2.1 (Release date: 2018-06-18)
==============

* New application that compares the OSL/IRSL stimulation power of measurements
  performed on Freiberg Instruments lexsyg devices to check the stability
  of the stimulation power (Contributed by Sebastian Kreutzer).
  Keyword for `app_RLum()`: 'teststimulationpower'.

* New application to calculate the fast ratio of CW-OSL curves after Durcan
  and Duller (2011). Base function: `Luminescence::calc_FastRatio()`.
  Keyword for `app_RLum()`: 'fastratio'.

* New application to estimate the g-value from a table of Lx/Tx values with
  corresponding waiting times since irradiation and to apply a fading
  after Huntley & Lamothe (2001).
  Base functions: `Luminescence::analyse_FadingMeasurement()`,
  `Luminescence::calc_FadingCorr()`.
  Keyword for `app_RLum()`: 'fading'.

* New application to fit eq. 1 of Sohbati et al. (2012a) or eq. 12 of
  Sohbati et al. (2012b) to OSL surface exposure data.
  Base function: `Luminescence::fit_SurfaceExposure()`.
  Keyword for `app_RLum()`: 'surfaceexposure'.

* Output panel showing the R code to reproduce the plot/calculation is now
  properly responsive and updates as soon as input widgets change.

* Internal: server logic of most applications simplified.

* Several minor bugfixes.

RLumShiny 0.2.0 (Release date: 2017-06-26)
==============

* Major overhaul of the data input panel for most applications. Uploaded text
  files are now imported via 'data.table::fread()', which automatically
  detects the delimiter and potential headers. Hence, all widgets related to
  data import are no longer required and were removed (#14).

* The input data can now be directly manipulated in the newly added spreadsheet(s)
  in the data input panels. The spreadsheets also allow copy and pasting of data,
  so uploading a file is no longer the only way to provide user data (#12).

* New Dashboard addin added. The dashboard provides access to all available
  applications in the package and can be accessed either (i) through the
  addin dropdown menu in the RStudio IDE or (ii) by running 'app_RLum()' without
  any keyword.

* Implemented newest shiny feature (v0.14) to bookmark the current app state.
  All apps now include a bookmark button, which returns a URL query string that
  can be used to restore the app's state at any later time.

* New application to plot filter combinations along with the optional
  net transmission. Base function: `Luminescence::plot_FilterCombinations()`.
  Keyword for `app_RLum()`: 'filter'. External contribution by Urs Tilmann
  Wolpert (Justus-Liebig-University Giessen) and Sebastian Kreutzer
  (Universite Bordeaux Montaigne).

* New package dependencies: 'shinydashboard', 'rhandsontable', 'data.table', 'readxl'

* transformCW-app:
    + the plot now also shows the CW-OSL data curve
    + improved error handling

* Internal: R dcoumentation re-written in Markdown using 'roxygen2 >=6.0.0'

* Several minor bugfixes.

RLumShiny 0.1.1 (Release date: 2016-07-20)
==============

* New application to transform CW OSL curves (keyword 'transformCW') using the
  functions 'CW2pHMi', 'CW2pLM', 'CW2pLMi' and 'CW2pPMi' of the R package
  'Luminescence'.

* Removed UI elements that used now deprecated function arguments.

* Added new UI elements for arguments added to functions after version 0.4.2 of
  the 'Luminescence' package.

* Removed the database feature in the abanico plot application.

* Removed dependencies on 'digest' and 'RCurl'.

* Removed all 'Exit' buttons.

* Code output to reproduce the plots is now generated dynamically and should
  be more reliable.

* R Luminescence Package Team now properly mentioned as contributors.

* Fixed many typos.
