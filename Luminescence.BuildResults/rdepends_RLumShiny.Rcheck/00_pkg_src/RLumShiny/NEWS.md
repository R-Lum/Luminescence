## RLumShiny 0.2.3 (Release date: 2022-01-29)

**This package version requires R \> 4.0!**

-   Updated `surfaceexposure` app now allows considering multiple mu
    values when using the global fit functionality.

-   The `filter` did not work anymore after changes in `'shiny'`; fixed.

-   The filter selector icons were deprecated, causing a warning in the
    terminal; fixed.

-   The app `RCarb App` did not work anymore after changes in `'shiny'`;
    fixed.

-   The app `scalegamma` started with an error message, because one
    option for a chosen conversion factor was wrong; fixed.

## RLumShiny 0.2.2 (Release date: 2019-01-11)

-   **PREVIEW**: New application that scales the gamma dose rate
    considering layer-to-layer variations in soil radioactivity. Base
    function: `Luminescence::scale_GammaDose()`. Keyword for
    `app_RLum()`: ‘scalegamma’.

    **NOTE**: This application will only start if the development
    version 0.9.x of the R package `Luminescence` is installed as the
    function `scale_GammaDose()` is still under development.

-   New application to support the new R package `RCarb`. Base function
    `RCarb::model_DoseRate()`. Keyword for `app_RLum()`: ‘RCarb’

-   Removed and updated deprecated links from the “About”-tab in all
    applications.

## RLumShiny 0.2.1 (Release date: 2018-06-18)

-   New application that compares the OSL/IRSL stimulation power of
    measurements performed on Freiberg Instruments lexsyg devices to
    check the stability of the stimulation power (Contributed by
    Sebastian Kreutzer). Keyword for `app_RLum()`:
    ‘teststimulationpower’.

-   New application to calculate the fast ratio of CW-OSL curves after
    Durcan and Duller (2011). Base function:
    `Luminescence::calc_FastRatio()`. Keyword for `app_RLum()`:
    ‘fastratio’.

-   New application to estimate the g-value from a table of Lx/Tx values
    with corresponding waiting times since irradiation and to apply a
    fading after Huntley & Lamothe (2001). Base functions:
    `Luminescence::analyse_FadingMeasurement()`,
    `Luminescence::calc_FadingCorr()`. Keyword for `app_RLum()`:
    ‘fading’.

-   New application to fit eq. 1 of Sohbati et al. (2012a) or eq. 12 of
    Sohbati et al. (2012b) to OSL surface exposure data. Base function:
    `Luminescence::fit_SurfaceExposure()`. Keyword for `app_RLum()`:
    ‘surfaceexposure’.

-   Output panel showing the R code to reproduce the plot/calculation is
    now properly responsive and updates as soon as input widgets change.

-   Internal: server logic of most applications simplified.

-   Several minor bugfixes.

## RLumShiny 0.2.0 (Release date: 2017-06-26)

-   Major overhaul of the data input panel for most applications.
    Uploaded text files are now imported via ‘data.table::fread()’,
    which automatically detects the delimiter and potential headers.
    Hence, all widgets related to data import are no longer required and
    were removed (`#14`).

-   The input data can now be directly manipulated in the newly added
    spreadsheet(s) in the data input panels. The spreadsheets also allow
    copy and pasting of data, so uploading a file is no longer the only
    way to provide user data (`#12`).

-   New Dashboard addin added. The dashboard provides access to all
    available applications in the package and can be accessed either (i)
    through the addin dropdown menu in the RStudio IDE or (ii) by
    running ‘app_RLum()’ without any keyword.

-   Implemented newest shiny feature (v0.14) to bookmark the current app
    state. All apps now include a bookmark button, which returns a URL
    query string that can be used to restore the app’s state at any
    later time.

-   New application to plot filter combinations along with the optional
    net transmission. Base function:
    `Luminescence::plot_FilterCombinations()`. Keyword for `app_RLum()`:
    ‘filter’. External contribution by Urs Tilmann Wolpert
    (Justus-Liebig-University Giessen) and Sebastian Kreutzer
    (Universite Bordeaux Montaigne).

-   New package dependencies: ‘shinydashboard’, ‘rhandsontable’,
    ‘data.table’, ‘readxl’

-   transformCW-app:

    -   the plot now also shows the CW-OSL data curve
    -   improved error handling

-   Internal: R dcoumentation re-written in Markdown using ‘roxygen2
    \>=6.0.0’

-   Several minor bugfixes.

## RLumShiny 0.1.1 (Release date: 2016-07-20)

-   New application to transform CW OSL curves (keyword ‘transformCW’)
    using the functions ‘CW2pHMi’, ‘CW2pLM’, ‘CW2pLMi’ and ‘CW2pPMi’ of
    the R package ‘Luminescence’.

-   Removed UI elements that used now deprecated function arguments.

-   Added new UI elements for arguments added to functions after version
    0.4.2 of the ‘Luminescence’ package.

-   Removed the database feature in the abanico plot application.

-   Removed dependencies on ‘digest’ and ‘RCurl’.

-   Removed all ‘Exit’ buttons.

-   Code output to reproduce the plots is now generated dynamically and
    should be more reliable.

-   R Luminescence Package Team now properly mentioned as contributors.

-   Fixed many typos.

## RLumShiny 0.1.0 (Release date: 2015-03-31)
