# NEWS for the R Package RLumModel

## Changes in version 0.2.10 (2022-02-20)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.0**

### New functions

-   `trace_ParameterStateEvolution()`: this new function allows tracing
    of the evolution of the concentration during the modelling for
    different steps. The functions returns a plot and/or numerical
    output of calculated end-states.

### New models

-   Add support for Bailey (2001) model variation of Peng et al. (2022,
    QG), keyword in `model_LuminescenceSignals()` is `"Peng2022"`

### Bugfixes/changes

#### `.set_pars()`

-   now consistently supports both spellings for the model
    `"customized"` and `"customized"`
-   now returns a character vector with the names of the allowed
    keywords if model is missing. This is also internally used in
    `model_LuminescenceSignals()` to avoid inconsistencies.
-   now returns also the parameter names and units as extra elements

#### `model_LuminescenceSignals()`

-   The parameter `own_state_parameters` now accepts (optionally) an
    `RLum.Results-class` object created by `RLumModel::.set_pars` as
    input

### Miscalaneous

-   A new vignette, called “RLumModel - Models and parameters” was added
    to provide a better overview and comparison of the different models
