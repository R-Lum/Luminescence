## OSLdecomposition `1.0.0` (2022-05-07)

-   First version released on CRAN
-   Added correction for PMT pulse-pair resolution to
    `RLum.OSL_correction()`
-   Added option to turn of automatic browser opening when reports are
    created
-   Fixed bug that report images are saved in the wrong directory at
    some systems
-   Removed `kableExtra` package dependency (now only suggested). This
    simplified the use on Linux systems because `kableExtra` needs the
    installation of not-standard system libraries (tested on Ubuntu
    20.04). The HTML reports have now differently formatted tables
    depending whether `kableExtra` is installed or not
-   Checked spelling and grammar in the whole package (thanks to C.
    Schmidt)
-   Changed used font, removed session info and made other minor style
    changes in the automatically created HTML reports to get more
    polished reports
