# Changes in version 1.1.1.9000 (2025-09-12)

## New functions

## Removed functions and deprecations

- The functions `CW2pHMi()`, `CW2pLM()`, `CW2pLMi()` and `CW2pPMi()`
  (deprecated since 1.0.0) have been removed, but their functionality
  remains in the corresponding `convert_CW2*()` functions (#992).

## Bugfixes and changes

### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`

- A warning was raised if the function returned early (for example due
  to invalid inputs) and the graphical device was off (#1001).
