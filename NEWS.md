# Changes in version 0.9.25.9000-6 (2024-07-05)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.3**

## Bugfixes

### read_BIN2R()

- `ignore.RECTYPE` now supports numeric values, e.g., 128. Records for
  this type will be ignored during import.
- BINX-files with `RECTYPE = 128` will not crash anymore, thanks for
  asking Anna-Maartje Boer and replying Karsten Bracht.

## Internals

- New internal function + tests added `.get_named_list_element()`. It
  just does what the names says.
