# Changes in version 0.9.25.9000-27 (2024-07-12)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.3**

## New functions

- `read_HeliosOSL2R()`: New import function to support the new zero rad
  Helios luminescence reader and its `.osl` file format. The output is
  an `RLum.Analysis-class` object.

## Bugfixes

### `calc_Huntley2006()`

- Improve success rate of GOK fitting of the unfaded data using a two
  step approach: first an exponential fit is applied then this values
  are used as start parameters.

### `plot_GrowthCurve()`

- The function now calculates the relative saturation (`n/N`) using the
  ration of the two integrates. The values is part of the output table.

### `plot_RLum.Data.Analysis()`

- The function now supports all arguments from
  `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`; before it had only basic functionality
  for `RLum.Data.Spectrum-class` data.

### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`

- The plot function can now handle non-increasing column values for
  plotting (with a warning).

### `read_BIN2R()`

- `ignore.RECTYPE` now supports numeric values, e.g., 128. Records for
  this type will be ignored during import.
- BINX-files with `RECTYPE = 128` will not crash anymore, thanks for
  asking Anna-Maartje Boer and replying Karsten Bracht.

### `read_PSL2R()`

- The function is out of the beta status, hence the flag was removed.
- The `RLum.Analysis-class` object returned by the function gained a new
  element `Sequence`, which is a data frame with the measured sequence.
  This way, if the original sequence was lost, it can still be extracted
  from the `.psl` data.

### `read_XSYG2R()`

- Fix spectrometer data import for basically broken files.

## Internals

- New internal function + tests added `.get_named_list_element()`. It
  just does what the names says.
