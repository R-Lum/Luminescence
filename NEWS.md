# Changes in version 1.1.2.9000-21 (2025-12-22)

## New functions

- `normalise_RLum()`: This function enables a fast normalisation of
  `RLum.Data.Curve-class`, `RLum.Data.Spectrum-class`,
  `RLum.Data.Image-class` and their combination in `RLum.Analysis-class`
  objects. Normalisation was already possible for plotting (e.g.,
  `plot_RLum.Data.Curve(…, norm = TRUE)`), which uses an internal
  function called `.normalise_curves()` to do the job. With
  `normalise_RLum()` we expose this functionality to `RLum-class`
  objects and enable a convenient normalisation of values that might
  come in handy in same cases. Normalised values are only count values.
  Currently implemented is normalisation via keywords, such as `’min’`,
  `’max’`, `’first’`, `’last’`, `’hout’`. Additionally, the function
  supports the normalisation to any real number (PR \#1250 by @RLumSK).

- `read_BINXLOG2R()`: This new function enables you to salvage log files
  created by a Risø reader into R as `RLum.Analysis-class`. The function
  also allows the export of these files into a BIN/BINX format. While
  the function has been tested on a few examples, it is important to
  note that log files are never a well-defined data format. This
  function is intended for use in cases where you have a corrupted
  BIN/BINX file but a complete log file is still available. Supported
  log formats are TL, OSL, and OSL curves. All other formats are
  ignored. Thanks to Michael Kenzler for bringing this to our attention
  (@RLumSK with \#1241).

## Removed functions and deprecations

- Functions `github_branches()`, `github_commits()`, `github_issues()`,
  `is.RLum()`, `is.RLum.Analysis()`, `is.RLum.Data()`,
  `is.RLum.Data.Curve()`, `is.RLum.Data.Image()`,
  `is.RLum.Data.Spectrum()` and `is.RLum.Results()` (deprecated since
  1.1.2) have been removed (#1242).

## Bugfixes and changes

### `analyse_baSAR()`

- The function has been updated to use `fit_DoseResponseCurve()` and
  `plot_DoseResponseCurve()` instead of `plot_GrowthCurve()`. This
  should not have any visible difference other than the renaming of two
  arguments: `output.plot` has been renamed to `plot_drc`, while
  `output.plotExtended` has been renamed to `plot_extended`. The old
  names are still functional but will produce a deprecation warning if
  used (#1244).

### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`

- The plots were affected by a bug in `plot_RLum.Analysis()`, so that
  the output was unnecessarily split over two pages (#1247).

### `analyse_IRSAR.RF()`

- The `slide$squared_residuals` field of the `@data` slot in the
  `RLum.Results` object returned by the function is no longer a 1-column
  matrix, but a plain numeric vector (#1254).

### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`

- No automated resetting of the dose value anymore, if
  `mode = "alternate"`. If the first dose point was \> 0, the function
  detected a dose-recovery test and automatically reset this dose point
  to 0. While this is likely convenient in 9 out of 10 cases, it caused
  trouble if the `mode = "alternate"` (passed on to
  `fit_DoseResponseCurve()` because it modified the first dose point and
  this required additional handling afterwards. Please keep in mind that
  you have to redefine the recuperation reference in such a case: this
  is wanted and not a bug (#9ff29bfd).

- The order of columns in the `rejection.criteria` data frame that is
  output by the function has been changed so that the `UID` column
  appears now first. This is meant to facilitate seeing visually to what
  aliquot each criteria belongs to. While the `UID` values are
  random-looking alphanumeric values, they can identify univocally an
  aliquot also after merge operations (#1172).

### `calc_OSLLxTxRatio()`

- The `signal.integral` or `background.integral` arguments are now
  better validated (#1252).

### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`

- The ability to combine multiple plots on a single page regressed in
  v1.1.2, causing plots intended to appear side-by-side to be rendered
  on separate pages (#1247).

### `read_XSYG2R()`

- Attributes from the record level are now all included in the `@info`
  slot, as long as they do not duplicate the attributes from the curve
  level. Hence, those attributes are now available for filtering (#1239;
  thanks to @DirkMittelstrass for reporting).

## Other changes

- The internal function `.normalise_curve()` received support to
  normalise against by the minimum value (`"min"`), the first values
  (`"first"`) or an arbitrary number (e.g, `2.2`) to be set by the user.
  This new settings are automatically available to
  `plot_RLum.Data.Curve(..., norm = <setting>)`.

- The package no longer depends on `RcppArmadillo`. This has no visible
  impact to the user other than a small reduction in the package size
  (#1254).
