# Changes in version 1.1.1.9000 (2025-10-15)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.4**

## New functions

## Removed functions and deprecations

- The functions `CW2pHMi()`, `CW2pLM()`, `CW2pLMi()` and `CW2pPMi()`
  (deprecated since 1.0.0) have been removed, but their functionality
  remains in the corresponding `convert_CW2*()` functions (#992).

- Functions `github_commits()`, `github_branches()` and
  `github_issues()` are now deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release (#1026).

- Functions `is.RLum()`, `is.RLum.Data()`, `is.RLum.Data.Curve()`,
  `is.RLum.Data.Spectrum()`, `is.RLum.Data.Image()`,
  `is.RLum.Analysis()` and `is.RLum.Results()`, and are now deprecated
  and will be removed in a future release. The best way of testing
  whether an object is of a given type is by using the `inherits()`
  function, as in `inherits(object, "RLum.Data.Curve")` (#1034).

## Bugfixes and changes

### `analyse_Al2O3C_CrossTalk()`

- The function no longer crashes if `dose_point` is misspecified
  (#1073).

### `analyse_baSAR()`

- The function no longer crashes if all objects in the input list are
  removed because empty (#1041).

- The dose response curves are no longer overplotted when there are
  fewer than 1000 MCMC iterations (#1058).

### `analyse_IRSAR.RF()`

- The function no longer crashes when `n.MC = NULL` is used with the
  `FIT` method (#1055).

### `analyse_portableOSL()`

- The size of the contour labels for `mode = "surface"` can now be
  controlled with the `...` argument `labcex` and scale with `cex`
  (#1075).

- The size of the interpolation grid can be controlled via the `...`
  arguments `nx` and `ny` (#1077).

- The `coord` argument is now better validated to avoid a crash in case
  of misspecification (#1097).

### `calc_EED_Model()`

- A crash that occurred with a small number of simulation was fixed
  (#1051).

- The error message in case of failed surface interpolation is now
  clearer and more complete (#1053).

### `calc_Huntley()`

- A warning raised in rare occasions if the number of Monte Carlo
  iterations is very small has been fixed (#1048).

### `combine_De_Dr()`

- It is now possible to control the random seeds used by the JAGS MCMC
  chains via the `method_control` argument (#1038).

### `fit_CWCurve()`

- If model fitting failed but an object named `fit` was present in the
  workspace, the function tried to use that one, which would lead to a
  crash or to unexpected results (#1081).

- The `output.table` field of the `RLum.Results` object returned now
  contains only columns corresponding to the components effectively
  fitted (#1083).

### `fit_EmissionSpectra()`

- The function makes better use of the plot area, leaving smaller
  margins around the plot (#1011).

### `fit_OSLLifeTimes()`

- The function throws a warning when the fit fails (#1005).

- The function makes better use of the plot area, leaving smaller
  margins around the plot (#1011).

### `install_DevelopmentVersion()`

- The function has been refactored so that it no longer depends on the
  deprecated `github_branches()` function (#1079).

### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`

- A warning was raised if the function returned early (for example due
  to invalid inputs) and the graphical device was off (#1001).

- The function now validates the `frame` argument in order to avoid
  crashing on misspecified values (#1036).

- The function no longer crashes when a small `plot.ratio` value is
  specified (#1062).

- The function now validates the `zlim` argument to avoid a crash if
  negative values are used with `log.z = TRUE` (#1063).

- The legend text now scales better at high `cex` values (#1066).

- If `summary.pos` contains multiple valid positions, use the first one
  rather than generating warnings and not showing the summary (#1093).

### `plot_DoseResponseCurve()`

- The plot symbols are now correctly assigned for
  `mode = "extrapolation"` and in the legend. If `reg_points_pch` is
  specified, it must now be a vector of 3 elements, corresponding to the
  symbols to use for normal points, point 0 and repeated points,
  respectively (#1072).

### `plot_RadialPlot()`

- The function avoids some possible overprinting at the extremes of the
  z-axis labels and draws lines at the extremes of the ellipse (#1013).

- The appearance of the y-axis ticks has been improved in the case when
  the y-axis is particularly narrow (#1060).

- If `summary.pos` contains multiple valid positions, use the first one
  rather than generating warnings and not showing the summary (#1093).

### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`

- Setting `records_max` to a value larger than the number of curves no
  longer generates spurious legend entries (#1017).

- The function now supports plotting of `RLum.Data.Image` objects
  contained in its records (#1028).

### `plot_RLum.Data.Image()`

- The function now supports the `...` argument `mtext` (#1031).

### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`

- The function doesn’t crash anymore if `bg.spectrum` is used and `ylim`
  specifies an interval that doesn’t contain any background channels
  (#1019).

- The function doesn’t crash anymore if the value of `frames` given is
  too large when `plot.type = "multiple.lines"` (#1021).

- The legend text now scales better at high `cex` values (#1068).

- The function now makes better use of the plot area by setting better
  margins and spacing between axis elements (#1070).

### `subset.Risoe.BINfileData()`

- The function also updates the `.RESERVED` slot (if present) to keep
  only the elements selected (#1089).

## Other changes

- The `ExampleData.portableOSL` file has been updated with surface
  coordinates (#1095).
