# Changes in version 1.0.0.9000 (2025-03-05)

## New functions

## Breaking changes

## Renamed functions and deprecations

## Bugfixes

### `analyse_baSAR()`

- The number of aliquots used was only partially reported if no aliquots
  were removed.

### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`

- The function checks that an input object generated from an XSYG file
  contains irradiation steps and returns an error if none are available,
  instead of producing an unhelpful output (#588).

- A regression in `plot_RLum.Analysis()` caused part of the plot of the
  luminescence curves to be messed up (#589).

### `analyse_pIRIRSequence()`

- The check on the minimum device plot size used to fail if only one
  dimension was below our minimum threshold, and when it was incorrectly
  triggered by the floating point values computed by
  `grDevices::dev.size()`, which sometimes could be spuriously just
  below threshold. We also changed the minimum device size from 18 to 16
  inches (#593).

### `calc_CosmicDoseRate()`

- The function crashed if the number of depths provided exceeded that of
  the densities and the latter contained more than one value (#595).

### `calc_FadingCorr()`

- The function sporadically returned an unplausibly large error estimate
  if any of the Monte Carlo simulations produced an outlier solution
  (#597).

### `calc_FastRatio()`

- The function crashed if the input was an RLum.Analysis object (#586).

### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`

- The `xlim`, `ylim` and `zlim` parameters are now better validated to
  avoid possible crashes if misspecified (#581).

### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`

- The function reset incorrectly the graphical parameters for the case
  `plot_singlePanels = TRUE`. This caused a regression in the plot
  output from `analyse_FadingMeasurement()` (#589).
