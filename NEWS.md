# Changes in version 0.9.24.9000-2 (2023-11-12)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.2**

## Bugfixes and changes

### `read_BIN2R()`

- Argument `n.records` can now be provided as a vector to specifically
  select records for the import. All other records are skipped and not
  imported. This can be useful in particular for very large
  BIN/BINX-files because allows importing single records very quickly
  without parsing the entire file
