# Changes in version 0.9.25.9000-10 (2024-07-08)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.3**

## Bugfixes

### `plot_GrowthCurve()`

- The function now calculates the relative saturation (`n/N`) using the
  ration of the two integrates. The values is part of the output table.

### `read_BIN2R()`

- `ignore.RECTYPE` now supports numeric values, e.g., 128. Records for
  this type will be ignored during import.
- BINX-files with `RECTYPE = 128` will not crash anymore, thanks for
  asking Anna-Maartje Boer and replying Karsten Bracht.

## Internals

- New internal function + tests added `.get_named_list_element()`. It
  just does what the names says.
