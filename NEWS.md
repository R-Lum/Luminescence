# Changes in version 1.0.1.9000-6 (2025-03-14)

## New functions

## Breaking changes

## Renamed functions and deprecations

## Bugfixes

### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`

- The function crashed if the number of `Lx` and `Tx` curves was not
  equal when `structure = c("Lx", "Tx")`, which is the default. The
  check that the number of points within each pair of curves has also
  been improved, and the function now produces more helpful error
  messages (#616).

### `calc_AliquotSize()`

- The function computed incorrectly the area of the container when
  computing the packing density in the case when argument
  `grains.counted` was provided, which resulted in smaller packing
  density (#621).

### `calc_OSLLxTxRatio()`

- The function returned a warning for wrong integral settings for the
  `Tx` curve even if no `Tx` curve was provided; fixed.
- The function does not check any more of different object types for
  `Lx.data` and `Tx.data` but validate objects for allowed types (this
  should have no user-visible effects)

### `calc_Huntely2006()`

- Add support for nls-fitting control arguments `maxiter` and `trace`.

### `convert_Concentration2DoseRate()`

- The function validates its input values more thoroughly (#613).

### `fit_DoseResponseCurve()`

- The function now allocates less memory for storing intermediate values
  (#610).

### `merge_RLum.Data.Curve()`

- The function does no longer stops for differing channel resolutions,
  but it does issue a warning. The user is responsible for the
  consequences.

### `sort_RLum()`

- The sorting mechanism for `RLum.Analysis-class` objects has been
  enhanced. It now enables sorting based on multiple parameters,
  including sorting all available `info_elements` in a prioritised
  manner (#606, \#620).
- Sorting now works on a list of `RLum.Analysis-class` objects. If the
  list contains other elements, they are passed through. The output is
  again a list (#620)
