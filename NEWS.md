# Changes in version 0.9.22.9000-2 (2023-02-03)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.1**

## Bugfixes and changes

### `convert_PSL2CSV()`

- The function still contained a bug if the parameters were combined in
  a certain way; fixed.

### `write_RLum2CSV()`

- The behaviour of the parameter `prefix` caused confusion, because in
  combination with multiple files the function overwrote created files,
  although this was wanted behaviour now the prefix is always added to
  the automatically created files names.
