## Changes in version 0.9.7 (2020-08-17)

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `analyse_Al2O3C_Measurements()`

  - Supplementary argument `main` never worked; fixed.
  - New supplementary argument `title` which allows to pass further
    names of a sample to the plot output.

#### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`

  - The plot now can handle negative values, fixed in combination with
    \#88 (reported by Sébastien Huot)

#### `plot_RadialPlot()`

  - Fix display problem when `log.z = FALSE` combined with negative
    values (\#88, reported by Sébastien Huot)

#### `read_BIN2R()`

  - Due to a typo, some bytes were read in the wrong order (big-endian
    instead of little-endian). While the fix does not affect the
    behaviour of the function, the non-fixed function would have soon
    crashed on CRAN servers. A big thanks to Tomas Kalibera from the
    CRAN team for his support and for pointing out this issue.

#### `internal_as.latex.table()`

  - The function gained a new argument `rm.zero` which is preset to
    `TRUE`. If set, all columns containing zero values only are removed.
    The new argument enables a better fine tuning of the latex output.

## Changes in version 0.9.6 (2019-12-05)

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `analyse_SAR_CWOSL()`

  - Setting the argument `plot.single = TRUE` does not any longer
    interferes with the global par settings for the rejection criteria
    plot.

#### `fit_OSLLifeTimes()`

  - The function gained a new argument `plot_simple` to produce plots
    without residuals that can be combined using standard R layout plot
    functionality, e.g., `par(mfrow = c(2,1))`.
  - Function now handles the `log = "x"`, `log = "y"` and `log = "xy"`
    options better.
  - In the self-call mode (imput is `RLum.Analysis-class` object), all
    `...` objects are supported as `list` and get recycled if the list
    does not equal the number of objects

#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`

  - The y-axis labelling of the test-dose response plot finally shows
    what was done since the beginning: the Tx values are normalised by
    the Tn values, i.e. Tn/Tx and not Tn/Tx. Thanks to Andrea Junge for
    spotting this flaw.

### `read_XSYG2R()`

  - The function now supports the temperature recalculation of TL curves
    even they consist of only a single point value.

### Internals

  - Changes in the development version of R caused error messages on
    CRAN and would have stopped the package from function properly in
    the future. This was corrected; the changes do not have any
    user-visible effect.
  - The internal function for the DRAC output `.as.latex.table()` gained
    a new argument `tabular_only` which gives a little bit more
    flexibility at hand of the output the DRAC is combined with LaTeX.

## Changes in version 0.9.4/0.9.5 (2019-09-20/2019-09-21)

### Important user visible changes

1.  **`plot_KDE()`** wrong error bars As it turned out, unfortunately,
    the error bars produced by `plot_KDE()` had been wrong since 2014.
    The input error values (2nd column in the data.frame) had been, for
    reasons we cannot recall anymore, divided by two leading to an
    ‘improved’ visualisation of uncertainties. A big thank goes to
    Andrea Junge (\#93) who made us aware of this bug.

2.  **The way the x-axis channels from BIN/BINX-files are generated
    changed** So far, during the file import, minimum and maximum values
    were taken, and channels were distributed equally according to the
    number of available data points. Thanks to Sébastien Huot for a
    constructive discussion.

<!-- end list -->

  - Example old behaviour: For an OSL curve recorded over 40 s with 100
    channels, the first channel was set at 0 s, the last channel to at
    40 s. Thus, the width of each channel was 0.404 s.

  - Example new behaviour: For an OSL curve recorded over 40 s with 100
    channels, the first channel is set to 0.4 s, the last channel to at
    40 s. Thus, the width of each channel is 0.4 s.

  - In other words, the first channel does not start anymore at 0 s, as
    it is the case, e.g., in the *Analyst*.

**Please note that these changes will impact your analysis results\!**

### Difference between version 0.9.4 and 0.9.5

Non-used dependency to ‘interp’ removed.

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`

  - The automated curve type recognition introduced with the last
    release broke the vignette of the R package ‘RLum.Model’; now
    refactored code prevent other people’s code from breaking.

#### `calc_CentralDose()`

  - The function does not crash anymore with an odd error if `NA` values
    are provided (\#82 reported by Sébastien Huot).
  - The function gained a new argument `na.rm` which is set to `FALSE`
    by default.

#### `plot_DetPlot()`

  - The argument `analyse_function.control` now understands the
    arguments `fit.method` and `fit.force_through_origin`.

#### `calc_MinDose()`

  - The final parameter estimates and their confidence intervals in the
    console output are now always reported in their absolute values,
    independent of whether the logged or non-logged model was used (\#84
    suggested by Sébastien Huot). This is a purely cosmetic change, and
    no changes to the calculations were made.
  - The values in the profile log-likelihood plots are now always given
    in their absolute values, independent of whether the logged or
    non-logged model was used (\#84 suggested by Sébastien Huot). This
    is a purely cosmetic change, and no changes to the calculations were
    made. The output object still returns the original profile objects
    with the logged values.
  - Improved handling of values close to zero if `bootstrap = TRUE`
    (\#91, reported by Andrea Junge).

#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`

  - Remove rounding from numerical output values (\#81 suggested by
    Sébastien Huot); this affects all subsequent functions. However,
    terminal and graphical output do not change.

#### Internals

  - The package `data/datalist` file listing the example data shipped
    with the package was not correct (\#85, CRAN comment); now
    corrected.

## Changes in version 0.9.3 (2019-07-31)

  - This version takes care of a CRAN note complaining about a non-used
    package declared in the Import fields.

## Changes in version 0.9.2 (2019-07-30)

  - This version fixes an URL problem discovered by the CRAN precheck

## Changes in version 0.9.1 (2019-07-30)

### Removed functions

  - `model_LuminescenceSignals()`: This wrapper function for the R
    package ‘RLumModel’ was removed due to changes on CRAN inflicting a
    warning ‘object is masked from ’package:Luminescence’ each time
    ‘RLumModel was loaded. In ’Luminescence’ the function had no real
    scope, but provided a place holder to point the users on the
    existence of the package ‘RLumModel’.

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `apply_EfficiencyCorrection()`

  - The function now suppors `RLum.Analysis` objects as input
  - All allowed input objects can now be provided as `list` (self-call
    support)
  - Minor code polish

#### `analyse_baSAR()`

  - The manual stated that `RLum.Analysis-class` are supported, but
    actually this is not true, it supports a list of `RLum.Analysis`
    objects only.
  - Some minor manual corrections.

#### `analyse_SAR.CWOLS()`

  - Add support for `POSL` data,before the function crashed (reported by
    Alice Versendaal). `POSL` curves had been not listed as supported
    curve types though.
  - Improve dataset recognition (`OSL`, `IRSL`, `POSL`).

#### `calc_Lamothe2003()`

  - The documentation wrongly stated that an input `data.frame` should
    have the columns ‘dose’, ‘De’ and ‘De error’, indeed ‘dose’, ‘LxTx’
    and ‘LxTx error’ are expected (spotted by Jeong-Heon Choi)

#### `calc_TLLxTxRatio()`

  - The `LxTx.Error` is no longer negative, even if the subtration lead
    to negative count values (\#78, reported by Sébastian Huot)

#### `calc_SourceDoseRate()`

  - The function learned about the half-life of Cs-137

#### `fit_OSLLifeTimes()`

  - `0` count values crashed the function for obvious reasons (`a / 0 =
    Inf`), this can happen in particular for artificial datasets. Now,
    if `0` is detected, count values are increased by `0.1` (reported by
    Dirk Mittelstrass)

#### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`

  - If `summary = "se.abs"` was chosen, the abanico plot showed `se.rel`
    instead; corrected (reported by Maryam Heydari)

#### `plot_DRTResults()`

  - Correct documentation, where it was erroneously implicated that the
    `...` argument pipes all arguments,
  - add support for argument `las`.

#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`

  - If the dose points included `NA` values the function crashed
    unexpectetly.

#### S4-classes and methods

  - `RLum.Analysis-class`
      - Code polish (no visible changes)
  - `RLum.Data.Curve-class`
      - Code polish and clearifying the documentation
  - `RLum.Data.Image-class`
      - Conversion methods to a `matrix` and from and to `data.frame`
        never worked as intended.
      - Code housekeeping

#### Internals

  - The ‘DESCRIPTION’ file contained the string “\[upcoming\]”. This was
    a left-over from the development version and is now removed.

  - Version numbering is now again more R canonical consisting only of
    three numbers (‘stable.major.minor’). Development versions are only
    indicated by `.9000` in the version number. Numbers after `9000`
    (e.g., `9000-1`) indicate build numbers. Both is used for GitHub
    build versions only.

  - The file name `RisoeBINfileData-class.R` was changed to
    `Risoe.BINfileData-class.R` for consistency reasons, however, this
    has no furhter visible effect (\#76, spotted by Sébastien Huot)

## Changes in version 0.9.0.110 (2019-04-21)

‘Luminescence’ 0.9.X releases will be the last versions supporting **R**
\< 3.5.0.

### Important R related changes (R \>= 3.6.0)

The behaviour of the base R function `sample()` was changed / corrected
(see news on <https://r-project.org> for details). This function is used
heavily within functions by ‘Luminescence’ (e.g., `plot_GrowthCurve()`).
That being said, it means that old data re-analysed by ‘Luminescence’
using R versions \>= 3.6.0 will not give the same results. Differences
are small, however, they may significant. If you want to reproduce your
data, we recommend to use one of our [Docker
images](https://github.com/R-Lum/RLumDocker) which include the R version
from the package release date.

### New functions

  - `convert_Wavelength2Energy()` Smooth and quick emission spectra
    conversion from wavelength to energy scales
  - `fit_OSLLifeTimes()` Fit and deconvolution of OSL lifetimes using
    off-time measurements, i.e. after the stimulation was switched off.
  - `plot_DRCSummary()` Summarise all dose-response curves from your SAR
    OSL analysis in one single plot.
  - `scale_GammaDose()` Scale the gamma dose rate considering
    layer-to-layer variations in soil radioactivity. Contributed by S.
    Riedesel and M. Autzen.
  - `fit_ThermalQuenching()` Provide an easy option to fit thermal
    quenching data and determine the activation energy.

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `apply_CosmicRayRemoval()`

  - Thanks to black magic, this function now runs also over a list of
    `RLum.Data.Spectrum` objects and and `RLum.Analysis` objects (also
    nested in a list)

#### `apply_EfficiencyCorrection()`

  - The function produced a warning (“collapsing to unique ‘x’ values”)
    on R-devel; fixed.

#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`

  - If the function was used in a self-call mode (object of type
    `list`), the arguments contrary to what is written in the manual,
    the arguments such as `signal.integral.min` had not been expanded
    properly; no one complained, however, corrected.
  - The argument `main` no also supports the input `list` in the
    self-call mode.

#### `analyse_SAR.TL()`

  - The plot legend was not correct, if no dose points had been
    provided; fixed
  - The function returned a confusion warning; fixed.
  - If background signals are provided, now the background subtracted
    signal is shown automatically instead of the uncorrected curves
    (suggestion by Tilmann Wolpert)
  - The function now supports a list of `RLum.Analysis` objects as input
  - The plot settings were sufficiently reset; fixed.
  - Code polish

#### `analyse_FadingMeasurements()`

  - Enable support for data imported from a BIN/BINX-file
  - If the g-value is negative, now it also returns a negative g-value;
    before always the absolute values was taken, which was not
    meaningful
  - If rho was negative, the log10 value could not be calculated, this
    caused an unwanted warning; now suppressed
  - It showed a warning on R-devel due to changes in `stats::approx()`;
    fixed
  - Records with negative ‘time since irradiation’ are now automatically
    removed (thanks to input by Sébastien Huot)
  - Function is now more relaxed when odd data a provided and it is less
    talkative

#### `calc_Huntley2006()`

  - The function now checks if rho’ (`rhop`) is a sensible non-zero
    positive value and, if otherwise, stops with a more meaningful error
    message. (Issue \#74)
  - Now the function is a little bit less talkative if extreme dataset
    are provided as input

#### `read_BIN2R()`

  - Add support for missing BINX-file version 5 (pointed out by Harrison
    Gray)
  - In the auto-file recognition (only a path instead of a file is
    provided), sometimes the found BIN/BINX-files were imported twice.
    The corresponding code was simplified to avoid such errors in future
  - Sometimes the time stamp is invalid since it is missing a leading
    `0`. For BINX-files \>= version 6 such timestamps now get corrected
    during the import

#### `read_XSYG2R()`

  - The function failed for R-devel importing spectrometer data
    (`approx(..., ties = -2)`); fixed.

#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`

  - The function crashed with `Error in data.MC[, i] : incorrect number
    of dimensions` under very particular circumstances (reported by
    Alice Versendaal). This was due to unwanted internal object
    conversion; fixed.

#### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`

  - The wavelength to energy scale conversion was not correct. This was
    corrected and internally, the function now calls consistently the
    new function `convert_Wavelength2Enegy()` (the corresponding code
    and documentation have been updated or removed).  
  - The function gained a new argument `norm` for normalising the data
    to the highest or the lowest count value.
  - The function gained a new argument `bg.spectrum` allow to pass a
    background spectrum that can be used for the subtraction
  - The function returned a warning if a single matrix was used but
    `plot.type` was already set to `single`; fixed.
  - Wrong settings in `bg.channels` crashed the function. Now it
    auto-corrects the wrong values.
  - Channel binning now consistently calls the internal function
    `Luminescence:::.matrix_binning()`, which is more efficient cleaner
    than the code used before
  - The function now longer crashes for `plot.type = 'persp'` if
    ’xaxis.energy = TRUE\`.
  - The colour picking option was not always working; fixed.
  - Warnings are formatted more nicely.

#### `verify_SingeGrainData()`

  - The function crashed for crazy datasets; fixed
  - Cleaning-up `RLum.Analysis-class` objects did not worked; fixed

#### `write_RLum2CSV()`

  - The function gained a new argument `compact` which is set `TRUE` be
    default, and keeps the element output as simple as possible, which
    is in particular helpful for `RLum.Results` objects
  - The function now behaves more friendly to `RLum.Results` objects,
    before the output was hard to understand.

#### `write_RLum2BIN()`

  - The export failed if the time stamp was invalid (`NA`); now `NA`
    values are consistently replaced by `000000` (other values are not
    possible, otherwise the re-import of such file would fail) (reported
    by Alice Versendaal via email, 2019-03-06)

### Changes in S4-objects and methods

#### `get_RLum`

  - The method working on `list` elements got a new argument `class` to
    remove unwanted `RLum` objects in from list of `RLum` objects

#### `RLum.Analysis-class`

  - The show-method crashed under very rare circumstances if
    inconsistent objects had been combined; fixed.

#### `RLum.Data.Spectrum-class`

  - Support added for `bin_RLum.Data()`

### New example datasets

  - `ExampleData.TR_OSL` provides a single fast-pulsing OSL curve that
    can be used to test the function `fit_OSLLifeTimes()`.

### Internals

  - Package news are now provided as markdown document (NEWS.md) which
    is supported by CRAN
  - The package version numbering scheme has been modified to simplify
    the distinction between different developer versions. While relevant
    numbers for CRAN remain X.X.X, which reads ‘stable.major.minor’
    version, a 4th number indicates the running package build number,
    e.g., 0.9.0.7.
  - New internal function `Luminescence:::.matrix_binning()` to get the
    matrix (and curve) binning consistent; so far used only by the the
    `bin_RLum.Data()` method for `RLum.Data.Spectrum-class`
  - Vignette S4-class object structure updated
  - Internal changes to address changes in R-devel checking logical
    arguments with length more than one (e.g., `if(is.na(x))` returned
    an error if `x` was not a vector of length 1)
  - `src/Makevars` file removed to prevent unconditional stripping in
    response to a recent CRAN request; in return the installation size
    of the package increased in size on some platforms.
