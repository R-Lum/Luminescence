# Changes in version 0.9.22 (2023-08-07)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.1**

## New functions

- `subset_SingleGrainData()`: the function provides a convenient sub
  setting of `Risoe.BINFileData-class` objects using a table of position
  and grain pairs

## Bugfixes and changes

### `convert_PSL2CSV()`

- The function still contained a bug if the parameters were combined in
  a certain way; fixed.

### `extract_IrradiationTimes()`

- Now silently handles `RLum.Analysis-class` objects imported via
  `read_BIN2R(..., fastFoward = TRUE)`, this allows to use the function
  in a more general manner.

### `merge_RisoeBINfileData()`

- Does not anymore throw an error if the number of input objects was
  smaller than two. It just passes the input through unchanged.

### `plot_DetPlot()`

- The function now returns a clear error message if the input object is
  not of type `RLum.Analysis`
- Edge case: the function does not crash anymore if used in a loop and
  if all equivalent doses were `NA`; it sill throws warnings though.
  (thanks to Annette Kadereit for reporting)

### `write_RLum2CSV()`

- The behaviour of the parameter `prefix` caused confusion, because in
  combination with multiple files the function overwrote created files,
  although this was wanted behaviour now the prefix is always added to
  the automatically created files names.
