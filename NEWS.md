## Changes in version 0.9.14.9000-13 (2021-06-16)

\*\* This package version requires at least R \>= 4.0.5 \*\*

### New functions

-   `calc_EED_Model()` Model incomplete and heterogeneous bleaching of
    mobile grains after Guibert et al.Â (2017). Along with the function,
    a new example data set `ExampleData.MortarData` was added.

-   `combine_Dr_De()` This function allows to model dose rate and
    equivalent dose distributions to obtain an age from Bayesian
    modelling using both distributions. In the back a couple of
    additional functions have been added to support this novel approach.
    This function requires [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io)
    (supported through `'rjags'`) on your computer along with a couple
    of other R packages prompted to you when you first try to use this
    function.

-   `plot_OSLAgeSummary()` Posterior distribution plot of ages. This
    function is used by `combine_Dr_Dr()`, however, it can be used as
    stand-alone plot.

-   `fit_EmissionSpectra()` Function for luminescence emission spectra
    deconvolution.

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`

-   Apparently the function never worked as intended for `XSYG` files;
    fixed. To prevent further problems, a test was added that monitors
    this functionality.

#### `verify_SingleGrainData()`

-   Improve terminal and plot output
-   Add minimal support for `...` to control plot output if wanted

### Internals

-   `mclust` added as new package dependency to support the new Bayesian
    models
