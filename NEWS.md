# Changes in version 1.1.2.9000-7 (2025-12-13)

## New functions

- `read_BINLOG2R()`: This new function enables you to salvage log files
  created by a Risø reader into R as `RLum.Analysis-class`. The function
  also allows the export of these files into a BIN/BINX format. While
  the function has been tested on a few examples, it is important to
  note that log files are never a well-defined data format. This
  function is intended for use in cases where you have a corrupted
  BIN/BINX file but a complete log file is still available. Supported
  log formats are TL, OSL, and OSL curves. All other formats are
  ignored. Thanks to Michael Kenzler for bringing this to our attention.

## Removed functions and deprecations

## Bugfixes and changes

### `read_XSYG2R()`

- Attributes from the record level are now all included in the `@info`
  slot, as long as they do not duplicate the attributes from the curve
  level. Hence, those attributes are now available for filtering
  (#1239).
