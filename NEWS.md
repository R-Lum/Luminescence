# Changes in version 1.1.0.9000-3 (2025-06-27)

## New functions

## New datasets

## Removed functions and deprecations

- Functions `calc_Kars2008()` (defunct since 0.9.26) and
  `Analyse_SAR.OSLdata()` (since 1.0.0) have been removed from the
  package. Their functionality can be found in `calc_Huntley2006()` and
  `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`, respectively.

## Breaking changes

## Bugfixes and changes

### `calc_AliquotSize()`

- The legend text now scales better at non-default cex settings (#849).

### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`

- The positioning of the y-axis label has been improved to be centred
  around the zero line (#847).

- The minor grid lines were drawn incorrectly in a rotated plot (#849).

### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`

- The legend text now scales better at non-default cex settings (#854).

### `plot_RLum.Data.Curve()`

- The function gained a new logical argument `interactive` that enables
  interactive plotting of curves using `plotly::plot_ly()`. It requires
  the suggested package `'plotly'` to be present (#e4746ea).

### `plot_DoseResponseCurve()`

- We added support for the `log` graphical parameter, which can be used
  if the fit was obtained with mode other than `"extrapolation"` (#820).

- The normal curve drawn as part of the histogram plot could appear very
  jagged or even as a straight line, as it could happen that too few
  points were actually used when drawing the curve (#843).
