# Changes in version 0.9.22.9000-11 (2023-03-16)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.1**

## Bugfixes and changes

### `convert_PSL2CSV()`

- The function still contained a bug if the parameters were combined in
  a certain way; fixed.

### `merge_RLum()`

- The functions does not crash anymore in cases only one object is
  handed over to `merge_RLum()` (which does not make sense anyway, but
  users tend to odd stuff)

### `merge_RisoeBINfileData()`

- Does not anymore throw an error if the number of input objects was
  smaller than two. It just passes the input through unchanged.

### `plot_DetPlot()`

- The function now returns a clear error message if the input object is
  not of type `RLum.Analysis`

### `write_RLum2CSV()`

- The behaviour of the parameter `prefix` caused confusion, because in
  combination with multiple files the function overwrote created files,
  although this was wanted behaviour now the prefix is always added to
  the automatically created files names.
