# Changes in version 0.9.25.9000-2 (2024-09-15)

## New functions

## Bugfixes

### `analyse_pIRIRSequence()`

- The function crashed with a object merge error if run in a loop
  because of a `merge_RLum()` error. This was caused by a regression
  while implementing the `n_N` calculation in `plot_GrowthCurve()`.
  Potentially affected was also `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`.

## Internals

- Two new internal functions `.throw_warning()` and `.throw_error()`
  sometimes flushed the terminal with messages if call (internally) in
  particular circumstances. Now the functions make only two attempts to
  get the name of their called and then return an `unknown()` as
  function name.
