Contributing to 'Luminescence' is simple and straightforward. 

## Workflow 
* [Create a fork][fork] of the 'Luminescence' repository
* Create your own branch with a name like `feature_<your feature>`,
`fix_<your fix>` or `new_<your new function>`
* Implement your changes
* [Push the branch][push] with your changes to your fork: please make
sure that your commits have a [valid signature][sign] (they should have
the `verified` tag on github)
* Create a [pull request][pull] against the master branch of the
'Luminescence' repository
* A series of tests will start automatically: they should all turn green
before merging is allowed; if not you'll have to fix the problems or have
a very good explanation why this is not possible
* Make your way through the review process
* ... your contribution gets merged

## Ground rules
* You pledge to abide by our [code of conduct][coco]
* Your contribution should be significant: if you just want to see a typo
fixed, it may be faster to open an issue instead
* We expect your code to follow the general package design and structure
(we'll help you with that during the review process)
* Your code **must follow** the [CRAN policy][CRAN]

In case you have questions, please contact the package maintainers before creating a pull request.
