Contributing to ‘Luminescence’ is simple and straightforward.

## Workflow

- [Create a
  fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)
  of the ‘Luminescence’ repository
- Create your own branch with a name like `feature_<your feature>`,
  `fix_<your fix>` or `new_<your new function>`
- Implement your changes
- [Push the
  branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)
  with your changes to your fork: please make sure that your commits
  have a [valid
  signature](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)
  (they should have the `verified` tag on github)
- Create a [pull
  request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
  against the master branch of the ‘Luminescence’ repository
- A series of tests will start automatically: they should all turn green
  before merging is allowed; if not you’ll have to fix the problems or
  have a very good explanation why this is not possible
- Make your way through the review process
- … your contribution gets merged

## Ground rules

- You pledge to abide by our [code of
  conduct](https://r-lum.github.io/Luminescence/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Your contribution should be significant: if you just want to see a
  typo fixed, it may be faster to open an issue instead
- We expect your code to follow the general package design and structure
  (we’ll help you with that during the review process)
- Your code **must follow** the [CRAN
  policy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html)

In case you have questions, please contact the package maintainers
before creating a pull request.
